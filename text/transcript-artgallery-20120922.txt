Front Yard
You stand at the front porch of a house. This old, Gothic mansion casts gloomy shadows all around you. A sharp wind cuts through your flesh to chill your bones. The pounding thunder grows louder and more threatening. A curiously-shaped knocker adorns the front door. Flanking the front door is a pair of marble statues. 

You can see a mailbox (which is closed) here.

BOOM! There is a mighty explosion behind you as your car bursts into flames. That will at least save you the cost of a tow. Better try to find your younger brother and have him call a cab instead of a tow truck.

>open mailbox
You open the mailbox, revealing an envelope.

>take envelope
Taken.

>open envelope
You open the envelope, revealing a letter and a pendant.

You recall your childhood fears of thunder and lightning as you remember how your uncle was struck while out golfing in a rainstorm.

>take pendant
Taken.

>wear pendant
You put the pendant around your neck.

>read letter
This note reads: 
"Dear Master. Please forgive me. My health prevents me from aiding you in your battle against the evil one. You teach your students well; they become too powerful for their own good. Enclosed is an amulet that should look familiar. Wear this charm and think of me. The undead fear symbology. Still the Evil, my friend; set it free for the sake of the family."

>put envelope in mailbox
You put the envelope into the mailbox.

>open door
The door creaks open.

From the sound of distant barking, you figure it must be a very large dog.

Entrance Hall
As you enter the mansion, the door slams closed behind you. Welcome home. You are inside the mansion's foyer. This is a large and luxurious room, yet it feels strangely oppressive. A hallway lies to the north. Another passage leads east.

Covering most of the floor is a room-sized carpet that displays a pentagram. In the east wall is a brick fireplace. Atop the rug is an expensive-looking wooden chair and a couch. A painting of a snake hangs above the fireplace. A painting of an eagle hangs on the west wall. A bust of a sailor stands on a pedestal by the fireplace.

On the mantelpiece is a kerosene lamp.

Lightning from the storm outside intensely illuminates the entrance hall. There is loud thunder quickly following as the storm approaches.

>take lamp
Taken.

Library
This room was designed for deep thought and research. Obviously it was once inhabited by a serious man of letters. The harsh silence in the rest of the house is muted in this room of contemplation. The east wall is completely covered with a bookcase. On the north wall is a framed star chart. A large, well-polished table dominates the middle of the room. Beside the table is an antique globe. The only exit is west.

On the table are a bronze statue and an ancient book.

>x chart
It's a map of the heavens -- a place you've always wanted to visit.

>put lamp on table
As you put the kerosene lamp on the table, it emits a faint hum.

>x chart
It's a map of the heavens -- a place you've always wanted to visit. You notice a very odd looking star on this chart that you didn't notice before.

Lightning from the storm outside intensely illuminates the library. There is loud thunder quickly following as the storm approaches.

>x odd looking star
It's a very odd star indeed. It's not at all an ordinary mark on paper. It's almost like it's not even there. There's no label or anything to tell you what it is.

>chant "specan heafod abraxas"
You hear rasping, incoherent speech coming from the nearby statue.

>star, "specan heafod abraxas"
The star, doesn't say anything, but you now realize you're looking at a black hole.

>x black hole
It look a lot of very powerful magic to retain an actual reduced version of a real black hole here on this star map in this old mansion -- probably an even greater amount to transport it here.

>enter black hole
Suddenly you experience a feeling quite unlike anything you've ever experienced before. Time and space as you know it are now foreign concepts. You feel what you think is a tremendous acceleration toward the black hole, but you don't know for sure what is happening to you. You're not sure if this experience will ever end. Then suddenly...

The Art Gallery

In the Art Gallery you can see a Greek urn, a Greek bowl, a Greek plate, a painting of a siren, a painting of an emperor and an onyx key.

>x urn
This actual 3000 year old Greek urn shows paintings and designs of different activities. Ever wonder why they NEVER showed any fat people? Were all the ancient Greeks thin as rails?

>x bowl
This bowl probably was used in an ancient Athenian temple during rush hour, as an incense holder. That, or the ancient Greeks ate some really HOT cereal, as evidenced by the burn-marks on its bottom

>x plate
The same motif as the urn and the bowl adorn this plate.

Lightning from the storm outside intensely illuminates the library. There is loud thunder quickly following as the storm approaches.

>! Events from the house still penetrate the black hole.

>x siren
The sultry and languid siren that adorns this canvas reminds you of some of Rembrandt's works. As you look into her eyes, you are drawn by her beconing gaze.

>x emperor
This painting is of the first emperor of the overly wealthy Rahngu Conetasch Dynasty. He was always fond of tossing his gems to the peasants, in large crowds, to gain favor from his people.

>x key
It's a brass key with a handle made of black onyx. Carved in the onyx is "Property of Mangar".

>take key
Taken.

Lightning from the storm outside intensely illuminates the library. There is loud thunder quickly following as the storm approaches.

>! This key wasn't in the original. Wonder what it's for -- maybe to unlock the door in the observatory?

>! Still no mention of the graffiti in the room description so no clue to PC to look at it.

>x graffiti
The graffiti is composed of a crude drawing of a man in obvious distress and some writing. It reads:

"When I first arrived here, it was all in black and white. Now all I see are words. If I remember correctly, I put the two lamps on top of each other, closed my inventory, examined the black hole, opened it, closed it, talked to it, then walked through. Then I found myself here. -- Stan Kaufman

>! Thanks for the mention!

>s
You can't go that way.

The loneliness of this abandoned estate makes you long for the company of your little brother. You have seen neither hide nor hair of him in quite a while. He should be somewhere on this estate. You'd better find him.

You can't see any such thing.
