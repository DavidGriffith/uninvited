>open door
You open the car door.
You smell leaking gasoline.

>get out of car

Front Yard
You stand at the front porch of a house. This old, Gothic mansion casts gloomy shadows all around you. A sharp wind cuts through your flesh to chill your bones. The pounding thunder grows louder and more threatening. A curiously-shaped knocker adorns the front door. Flanking the front door is a pair of marble statues. 

You can see a mailbox (which is closed) here.

BOOM! There is a mighty explosion behind you as your car bursts into flames. That will at least save you the cost of a tow. Better try to find your younger brother and have him call a cab instead of a tow truck.

>open mailbox
You open the mailbox, revealing an envelope.

>open envelope
You open the envelope, revealing a letter and a pendant.

>take pendant
Taken.

>wear pendant
You put the pendant around your neck.

>i
You're carrying:
  a pendant (being worn)

>open door
The front door creaks open.

Entrance Hall
As you enter the mansion, the door slams closed behind you. Welcome home. You are inside the mansion's foyer. This is a large and luxurious room, yet it feels strangely oppressive. A hallway lies to the north. Another passage leads east.

Covering most of the floor is a room-sized carpet that displays a pentagram. In the east wall is a brick fireplace. Atop the rug is an expensive-looking wooden chair and a couch. A painting of a snake hangs above the fireplace. A painting of an eagle hangs on the west wall. A bust of a sailor stands on a pedestal by the fireplace.

On the mantelpiece is a kerosene lamp.

(first opening the hall door)

Hall
This room is devoid of any aesthetic warmth or beauty. It is purely functional, with no concern for the trivialities of interior design. To the south is the foyer. Two doors go southwest and west. One door goes east. A staircase leads up. A small painting hangs between the two west-facing doors. Near the staircase is a framed sepia-toned photograph with some writing on it.

Lightning from the storm outside intensely illuminates the hall. There is loud thunder quickly following as the storm approaches.

>u

Upstairs Hallway
The old wooden floorboards creak under your weight. Your creaking footsteps echo through the emptiness of the huge house. Doors lead west, northwest, east, northeast, and southeast. A stuffed fish hangs on the wall at the end of the hallway.

You now have to question the reliability of your eyes. You think you see a somewhat cute, abstract creature with a brass key in its hand prance by. You're not sure whether it's your eyes or your mind playing tricks on you. It could be both.

The gremlin skitters away, waving a brass key.

Loud thunder echoes all around you as the storm outside intensifies.

(first opening the closet door)

Storage Closet
This is a good-sized closet with lots of room for bric-a-brac. Several shelves line the walls. A bare light bulb hangs from the ceiling. You can leave the way you came in, to the north-west.

On the shelf are a filthy bowl, an ashtray, a bottle of No-Ghost, a detergent box, a cardboard box, a thin box, a hatbox, a can of pesticide and a can of spider cider.

A mop leans against the wall.

You can also see a broom and a tarp here.

Loud thunder echoes all around you as the storm outside intensifies.

>take no-ghost, spider cider
bottle of No-Ghost: Taken.
can of spider cider: Taken.

>open no-ghost
As you remove the cap from this small bottle, a foul odor bombards your olfactory senses. The liquid contents of this nearly empty bottle produce a smell similar to that of an injured skunk. It reminds you of the smell of decay that surrounds the house itself.

(first opening the parlor door)
As you touch the doorknob, a strange woman appears. She is dressed like Scarlett O'Hara and stands with her back to you. You pause in wonder.

>throw no-ghost at woman
You splash the foul-smelling liquid on the head of the over-dressed guest. The liquid seems to burn as it drips over her. She lets out a horrifying scream as she begins to melt helplessly. Suddenly you feel like Dorothy (and her little dog too).

>e

Parlor
This parlor has lost its original charm. The cracked, dirty walls are a testament to the estate's state of disrepair. A simple chandelier hangs from the ceiling. An antique chair sits in a corner. In the opposite corner is a large vase of artificial flowers. A veranda can be seen outside to the east. The hallway is to the west.

You can see a vase (in which are some artificial flowers) here.

>e

Veranda
From here you have a splendid view of the desolate estate.

A large black spider quickly runs by you along the railing.

>spray spider cider on railing
A wide aerosol stream sprays from the "Spider Cider" can. It leaves a wet, sticky film on the railing.

From the sound of distant barking, you figure it must be a very large dog.

You see the spider continue its trek across the railing. It becomes paralyzed as it comes into contact with the "spider cider". It's not dead, but it's not going anywhere without your help.

>take spider
(the black spider)
Taken.

A strange creature resembling an eyeball with wings passes in front of you. Did you ever get the feeling that you were being watched?

>drop spider cider
Dropped.

Dining Room
This is an impressive sight. You could throw a terrific birthday bash in this room. The odor of stale wine still permeates the air. On the north and south walls are large paintings. Doors lead east to the hallway, north, south, and west.

You can see a dining table (on which are a bouquet of flowers, a champagne bottle (which is empty), a pepper mill and a pewter bowl (in which are a banana, a plum and an apple)) here.

>take bouquet
Taken.

>w

Kitchen
Upon entering the kitchen, you realize that this room is probably the most modern room in the house. After all, it appears to have been remodeled sometime during the 20th century. The cabinets are very well-made. Small doors head north and south. The dining room is to the east.

On the counter are a menacing knife, a little knife, a cleaver, a chef knife and a stained cookie jar.

On the pot rack are a frying pan, a nonstick pan, a shiny pan, a sauce pan and a roasting pan.

You can see some cabinets here.

Pantry
This pantry smells musty and stuffy. Patches of wallpaper are missing in several spots. This tiny little room does not fit in with the rest of this sprawling palatial estate. A lamp hangs from the ceiling.

On the shelf are a pewter plate, a silver tray, a matchbox, a salami, a kitchen knife, a beater, a baster, a spatula and a thermometer.

You can see a bag of flour, a bag of rice, a bag of sugar and a bag of salt here.

>take matchbox
Taken.

Servant's Bedroom
Whoever had occupied this room must have been quite satisfied with the small accomodations. There is a simple bed, a floor lamp, and a dresser. A small painting hangs on the wall above the bed. This room does not seem quite as untidy as the rest of the house. You see no dust or cobwebs.

On the bed is a little pillow.

On the dresser are a brush and a cologne bottle.

Lightning from the storm outside intensely illuminates the servant's bedroom. There is loud thunder quickly following as the storm approaches.

>turn on lamp
As you turn on the lamp, you see the picture on the wall slide to your left, revealing a small niche in the wall.

Your tired eyes are having trouble focusing on the ghostly figure before you. An angry man's spirit hovers, in chains, in front of you. The ghost speaks: "This is my room. Who let you in here?! These are not the Master's things. They're mine. MINE. MINE. MINE...

>show spider to ghost
The posessive ghost shrieks at the sight of the stunned spider. Flustered and frightened, the spirit dissolves from view, leaving you alone again.

>search niche
In the niche is a dusty journal.

The loneliness of this abandoned estate makes you long for the company of your little brother. You have seen neither hide nor hair of him in quite a while. He should be somewhere on this estate. You'd better find him.

>read journal
"The Master would, or could, not, so I have stolen Dracan's star. He is an evil soul. Unlike the Master, he uses his power for amusement and profit. He is not concerned with spiritual enlightenment. There is no compassion with his power. I grow weak. I am dying. I have hidden the star in Master's special box. It never opens, it has no locks. Dracan's star never discerns. In fire, it freezes. In ice, it burns."

That was definitely not your imagination. This little creature is definitely running circles around you.

You slash the upholstery of the chair with the chef knife.

You slash the upholstery of the couch with the chef knife and discover a skeleton key.

There goes your friend running by again. He is not very sociable. He didn't even say hello.

Master Bedroom
This must be the master bedroom. Interesting decor. There is a stale smell about this room, as if it hasn't been opened for years. Along the west wall are a row of photographs and a large wardrobe. Pushed up against the north wall is a large, comfortable-looking bed. Beside it is a floor-standing lamp. The hallway lies east. Another doorway faces south.

You can see a wheelchair and a table (on which are a black diary, a grey candle, a blue bottle (which is empty) and a brown bottle) here.

>unlock wardrobe
What do you want to unlock the wardrobe with?

>key
You unlock the wardrobe.

Loud thunder echoes all around you as the storm outside intensifies.

>open wardrobe
You open the wardrobe, revealing a small papyrus scroll, a large papyrus scroll, a wooden box and a golden vial.

>read small scroll
"Together these form a key: californium, cesium, and cadmium".

>read large scroll
"The heart of the garden maze contains the Blothney Gem. There are certain places you cannot go, 'till you unlock the 'mystery'".

Taken.

The kiddie creature runs past waving his brass key. The way he runs around he must get very hungry. This little devil must eat something that makes him awfully hyper.

The gremlin rockets out of the room, waving a brass key.

>open matchbox
You open the matchbox, revealing six matches.

>take match
Taken.

>strike match on matchbox
The blue tip on this short stick bursts into flame.

>put match on wood
That's better. The dry firewood quickly catches fire. Now it's not so chilly.

>put wooden box on fire
As you toss the box into the fire, a large thick, puff of smoke jumps out. As the smoke clears you notice a brass pentagram that apparently survived the burning of the box has jumped out as well.

>take pentagram
(the brass pentagram)
Taken.

>i
You're carrying:
  a brass pentagram
  a skeleton key
  a matchbox (which is open)
    five matches
  a bouquet of flowers

  a pendant (being worn)

The evil air that pervades the estate seems to have infiltrated your very being. Your head and chest feel heavy and thick. You find it increasingly difficult to execute your will. For a minute, your thoughts seemed influenced by another mind.

(first opening the recroom door)

Rec Room
This looks like a room designed for fun and games. It seems out of place on this gloomy estate. To the west is a rustic-looking door. On the east and west walls are some rather ugly paintings. The dining room is to the north. The hallway is to the east.

You can see a chess table, a gramophone and a cabinet here.

Trophy Room
The walls of this room are lined with the heads of dead animals. A mounted bear stands in a corner. A tiger skin covers the middle of the floor. To the north is a door leading outside. You can go back to the rec room using the door to the east.

Backyard
This large expanse of backyard reminds you of the "Wizard of Oz". A path leads north across the lawn to three buildings far in the distance.

>n

Yard Path
You stand at a four-way intersection of paths. North is a greenhouse. West is an observatory. East is an old chapel.

A strange creature resembling an eyeball with wings passes in front of you. Did you ever get the feeling that you were being watched?

Greenhouse Entrance
You stand before the entrance to a greenhouse. The glass is covered with what appears to be dust and condensation inside.

Greenhouse
This steel and glass structure must have once housed a multitude of life-forms. Now potted corpses inhabit shallow, clay graves. It seems that living organisms don't do too well on this estate. Whoever lived here must have had a gold touch, but no green thumb.

On the table are a blue pot, a brown pot, a yellow pot, a green pot, a red pot and a white pot.

You can see a watering can (in which is some water) here.

>x blue pot
It's a blue pot.
In the blue pot this dead plant used to be a fern, perhaps.

Nothing is growing in the parched and thirsty soil contained in the brown pot.

The gremlin prances away, waving a brass key.

Bedroom
This room has a strange energy about it. There is a powerful presence in here. You do not feel alone, just insignificant.

Against the north wall is a bed and bedside table. Above the bed is a small reading lamp. Opposite the bed, on the south wall, is a large, abstract painting. On the west wall is a large wardrobe. The hallway is to the east. A small door is in the north wall.

On the bedside table are a red candle and a star diary.

You can also see a bed (on which are a white pillow and a black pillow) here.

Bathroom
This bathroom is cold and dark. You can see a white sink and a porcelain bathtub here. There is no toilet. Whoever lived here really did have a mysterious way of doing things. The door is to the south. Your attention is drawn to a strangly-shaped light fixture on the ceiling.

You can see a drain, two towels, a laundry hamper and a marble shelf (on which is a bar of soap) here.

You recall your childhood fears of thunder and lightning as you remember how your uncle was struck while out golfing in a rainstorm.

>instantum illuminaris abraxas
That's not a verb I recognize.

>chant "instantum illuminaris abraxas"
With the utterance of these magic words comes a blinding bolt of lightning and a blast of thunder.

At this, the dogs recoil. They put their tails between their legs and scamper across the grounds of the estate. You now have access to the chapel door. From now on you might want to watch where you step.

At this point you begin to worry about your little brother. You were supposed to take care of him, but you have not seen him for hours. You pray that no harm has come to him.

Upstairs Hallway
The old wooden floorboards creak under your weight. Your creaking footsteps echo through the emptiness of the huge house. Doors lead west, northwest, east, northeast, and southeast. A stuffed fish hangs on the wall at the end of the hallway.

The kiddie creature runs past waving his brass key. The way he runs around he must get very hungry. This little devil must eat something that makes him awfully hyper.

The gremlin skitters away, waving a brass key.

Hall
This room is devoid of any aesthetic warmth or beauty. It is purely functional, with no concern for the trivialities of interior design. To the south is the foyer. Two doors go southwest and west. One door goes east. A staircase leads up. A small painting hangs between the two west-facing doors. Near the staircase is a framed sepia-toned photograph with some writing on it.

The quick creature seems to be playing a 'catch-me-if-you-can' game. He's winning. He waves his brass key wildly, teasing you with it as he runs through the room.

Greenhouse
This steel and glass structure must have once housed a multitude of life-forms. Now potted corpses inhabit shallow, clay graves. It seems that living organisms don't do too well on this estate. Whoever lived here must have had a gold touch, but no green thumb.

On the table are a blue pot, a brown pot, a yellow pot, a green pot, a red pot and a white pot.

Chapel
You stand in solemn awe in this abandoned house of worship. In the silence you can hear the prayers of righteous predecessors. You feel the presence of many long-dead worshippers. You feel yourself a stranger, yet you feel protected. Beside the altar is a statue upon a pedestal. In the east wall, beside the altar is a beautiful and very large stained glass window. There is a heavy-looking side door in the north wall, which is closed.

On the stone altar are a cross and a white candle.

As you move the cross you see the altar move to the side, revealing a small, dark hole.

Again, the evil that dwells within the estate vie for control of your spirit. Its influence grows more and more powerful. Soon you will not have the strength to fight it off. You can feel the spirits collected here are anxiously anticipating your induction.

The match you lit before has now gone out.

>statue, "specan heafod abraxas"
The marble bust moans these words: "Master. Please open thy door for this poor family man. But do not let him travel in darkness."

The side door swings open.

Church Grounds
You are standing on a path that leads up to a large stone structure. Beyond the structure you see a forest that looks as if it has been ravaged by decay.

As you leave the chapel, a strange ghost flies over you. It does not attack you. The glow of the candle dims the presence of the ghost. It is offended by the flame and flies off to its supernatural home.

A strange creature resembling an eyeball with wings passes in front of you. Did you ever get the feeling that you were being watched?

Three Cages

Many of the voices in your mind are not your own. You begin to feel almost at home here among the undead. To your dismay the other world is beginning to look more attractive to you than this one. Its inhabitants beckon to you, but you are not yet ready to join them. You do not know where you found this final reserve of willpower. It came not a moment too soon; it is almost too late.

>unlock cages with key
This one key unlocks the three cages simultaneously. The iron-barred doors spring open. Three animals jump out of the cages. They are bewildered by their freedom and new surroundings. They also look hungry.

>catch bird with small cage
Before the dazed bird can spread its wings, you grab and quickly trap it in the portable cage. The bird is unharmed, but the uncaged animals then furiously attack each other. The cat snarls but the snake counters with a quick, venomous strike. The poison goes from the snake's fangs to the cat's bloodstream and easily disables and kills the formerly ferocious feline. The snake then swallows the cat with surprising speed.

From the sound of distant barking, you figure it must be a very large dog.

Taken.

The gremlin rockets out of the room, waving a brass key.

You're carrying:

Hall
This room is devoid of any aesthetic warmth or beauty. It is purely functional, with no concern for the trivialities of interior design. To the south is the foyer. Two doors go southwest and west. One door goes east. A staircase leads up. A small painting hangs between the two west-facing doors. Near the staircase is a framed sepia-toned photograph with some writing on it.

There goes your friend running by again. He is not very sociable. He didn't even say hello.

>throw cookie at gremlin
You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.

The gremlin zooms away, waving a brass key.

You see no to gremlin here.

The loneliness of this abandoned estate makes you long for the company of your little brother. You have seen neither hide nor hair of him in quite a while. He should be somewhere on this estate. You'd better find him.

Parlor
This parlor has lost its original charm. The cracked, dirty walls are a testament to the estate's state of disrepair. A simple chandelier hangs from the ceiling. An antique chair sits in a corner. In the opposite corner is a large vase of artificial flowers. A veranda can be seen outside to the east. The hallway is to the west.

Rec Room
This looks like a room designed for fun and games. It seems out of place on this gloomy estate. To the west is a rustic-looking door. On the east and west walls are some rather ugly paintings. The dining room is to the north. The hallway is to the east.

You can see a chess table, a gramophone and a cabinet here.

>w

Trophy Room
The walls of this room are lined with the heads of dead animals. A mounted bear stands in a corner. A tiger skin covers the middle of the floor. To the north is a door leading outside. You can go back to the rec room using the door to the east.

>n

Backyard
This large expanse of backyard reminds you of the "Wizard of Oz". A path leads north across the lawn to three buildings far in the distance.

>n

Yard Path
You stand at a four-way intersection of paths. North is a greenhouse. West is an observatory. East is an old chapel.

>w

Observatory Entrance
You stand at the entrance of a large domed building to the west. The ugly, elaborate doorway is endowed with a strange, eclectic mix of decorations from at least three different centuries. Two brass orbs atop spires are to the left and right of the door. Just above the door, in the doorframe is an oddly-shaped niche. On the wall above the doorway is a sign reading "Magisterium".

>w

Observatory Corridor
You're in a short corridor in the observatory. The door leading outside is to the east. To the west is a door with a star on it. To the north is a door with what appears to be a relief of the planet Saturn. The door to the south has nothing on it. There is a curious-looking light fixture on the ceiling.

>w

Laboratory
This looks like Doctor Frankenstein's laboratory. You wonder what experiments were performed in here, and by whom. You do not feel very comfortable in here. Embedded in one wall is a small iron safe. In another wall is a small fireplace. A doorwal leads east. A trap door set flush in the floor is closed

You can also see a table (on which is an array of lab equipment) here.

>save

Please supply a filename for save
Ok.

>open trapdoor
You open the trap door.

>d

Cave
You slide, thigh deep, into this bubbling tarpit. You nearly choke on the noxious odor of flesh in decay. Your stomach turns as you slide deeper into the tar. A bat flies by as you watch. You hope it was only a bat. This passage continues north. A side corridor to the west is encrusted with ice. In the ceiling is a trap door.
 A trap door set flush in the floor is open

>w

Ice Cave
You stand in a section of cave that is mysteriously frozen. There is an exit to the south. The entire northern part of the cave is covered with a wall of ice.
An acrid mist rises from the frozen sludge of the ice-encrusted cave. The misty tendrils form themselves into a robed human figure. He has an almost benevolent appearance. He speaks directly to you.

"You've come. I've been waiting for you... for you!"

The mists reform and the old man disappears.

>put pentagram on ice
You put the brass pentagram into the ice. Instantly the star glows red and a strange creature appears. It is shaped like a pyramid covered with flames. It approaches the ice mass and engulfs it. Steam bursts from the block as it rapidly melts. The melting ice creates a flow of water that rushes into the next cave. The current sweeps a human figure from within the ice into the next cave. The robed man reappears and speaks directly to you.

"You must hurry, my son! I've been waiting for a very long time. So has HE. We both lack patience. Hurry and get rid of him -- as far away as possible!"

The old man disappears again.

>n

Cave
This oblong cave contains a strange stone altar. In its center is a deep pit. The southern end of this cave is covered in water, past which is a low passage. To the north is another passage, but dry.

You can see a body here.

>push body into pit
You push the robed man into the dark bottomless pit. His moan echoes for quite some time, gradually fading.

The evil air that pervades the estate seems to have infiltrated your very being. Your head and chest feel heavy and thick. You find it increasingly difficult to execute your will. For a minute, your thoughts seemed influenced by another mind.

>n

Stairway
A dark, dirt-walled stairway leads up towards a door to the west. Stone and dirt are tightly packed together to form the solid, damp walls. You wonder how long this cavern has existed. You cannot even venture a guess. How old is the house?

>n
You can't go that way.

>u
You can't go that way.

>w
You can't since the wooden door is in the way.

>unlock door with key
Which do you mean, the brass key or the skeleton key?

>brass
You unlock the wooden door.

>w
You can't since the wooden door is in the way.

>open door
You open the wooden door.

>w
You can hear the high-pitched moans of a young boy and something else. You recognize the pained voice as that of your little brother. It is the first sign of him you have encountered. The sounds seem to emanate from upstairs. The screams cut off suddenly... the silence is deafening.

Study
You're in a small study. A small desk squats in the middle of the room. To the east is a door. To the south is the dining room.

On the desk is a blotter.

The drawer in the desk contains a notebook.

>s

Dining Room
This is an impressive sight. You could throw a terrific birthday bash in this room. The odor of stale wine still permeates the air. On the north and south walls are large paintings. Doors lead east to the hallway, north, south, and west.

You can see a dining table (on which are a champagne bottle (which is empty), a pepper mill and a pewter bowl (in which are a banana, a plum and an apple)) here.

>e

Hall
This room is devoid of any aesthetic warmth or beauty. It is purely functional, with no concern for the trivialities of interior design. To the south is the foyer. Two doors go southwest and west. One door goes east. A staircase leads up. A small painting hangs between the two west-facing doors. Near the staircase is a framed sepia-toned photograph with some writing on it.

>u
Your brother's screams get louder as you enter the upstairs hallway. You must be getting closer to him.

Upstairs Hallway
The old wooden floorboards creak under your weight. Your creaking footsteps echo through the emptiness of the huge house. Doors lead west, northwest, east, northeast, and southeast. A stuffed fish hangs on the wall at the end of the hallway.

>nw

Bedroom
This seems to be an ordinary bedroom. Against the north wall is a bed and bedside table. Above the bed is a small reading lamp. Opposite the bed, on the south wall, is a large, abstract painting. On the west wall is a large wardrobe. The hallway is to the east. A small door is in the north wall.

On the bedside table are a red candle and a star diary.

You can also see a bed (on which are a white pillow and a black pillow) here.

>n

Bathroom
This bathroom is cold and dark. You can see a white sink and a porcelain bathtub here. There is no toilet. Whoever lived here really did have a mysterious way of doing things. The door is to the south. Your attention is drawn to a strangly-shaped light fixture on the ceiling.

You can see a drain, two towels, a laundry hamper and a marble shelf (on which is a bar of soap) here.

As you enter the bathroom, the door slams shut behind you. Your brother's screams are deafeningly loud in here; it almost seems as if he is on top of you. It's as if someone or something wants you to be here.

The faucet in the tub has turned itself on and the drain appears to have stopped functioning.

>x fixture
This large light fixture vaguely resembles something from a playground that children like to hang and swing from.

The water continues flowing, flooding the bathroom.

>put towel in sink
You need to be holding the towel before you can put it into something else.

Your feet now start getting wet. You were really in no hurry to take a bath, but there are some things beyond your control.

>take towel
Taken.

Your feet are now completely underwater.

>put towel in sink
You put the towel into the sink.

Lightning from the storm outside intensely illuminates the bathroom. There is loud thunder quickly following as the storm approaches.

The water has risen up to your knees.

>take towel
Taken.

The water is about mid-thigh-depth.

>put towel in tub
You put the towel into the porcelain bathtub.

The water comes up to your waist.

>turn light fixture
(to that)
You can't set that to anything.

The water is about chest deep now.

>grab light fixture
You can't reach the light fixture.

Loud thunder echoes all around you as the storm outside intensifies.

You can barely keep your head above water yet have your feet on the floor.

>swim up
I only understood you as far as wanting to swim.

>swim
There's not enough water to swim in.

You begin to feel a sense of urgency concerning your little brother. You feel that all is not well. Somewhere on this estate he waits for you to come save him. You must get to him in time.

The water is now too deep to touch bottom and breathe. You are now treading water.

>grab light fixture
You can't reach the light fixture.

Lightning from the storm outside intensely illuminates the bathroom. There is loud thunder quickly following as the storm approaches.

Treading water, you rise towards the ceiling.

>g
You can't reach the light fixture.

The ceiling gets closer as you rise on the water.

>grab light fixture
You can't reach the light fixture.

The ceiling is within arm's reach as you tread water.

>grab light fixture
You grab the fixture and pull. It comes loose, revealing a large hole in the ceiling.

Loud thunder echoes all around you as the storm outside intensifies.

While treading water, you bump your head on the ceiling.

>u
You grab the edges of the hole and pull yourself through.

Secret Room
This small, claustrophobic chamber is stuffy and cold. It has a single large dirty window. The air in here is so thick that you can barely catch your breath. An iron hatch hinged to cover the hole in the floor from whence you emerged leans against the wall.

Your brother babbles curses and blasphemies. Every few seconds he emits a loud shriek.

You managed to get your feet over the sink. Standing there, your head is pressed against the ceiling as the water rises to your chin.

>i
You're carrying:
  a brass key
  an axe
  a white candle (providing light)
  a skeleton key
  a pendant (being worn)

There is very little space left for you to breath. Finally the room is completely filled with water.

>break window with axe
You shatter the window.

You can hold your breath for only so long. Now you take water into your lungs, black out, and drown.
