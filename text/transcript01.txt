>get out

Front Yard
You stand at the front porch of a house. This old, Gothic mansion casts gloomy shadows all around you. A sharp wind cuts through your flesh to chill your bones. The pounding thunder grows louder and more threatening. A curiously-shaped knocker adorns the front door. Flanking the front door is a pair of marble statues. 

You can see a mailbox (which is closed) here.

>open mailbox
You open the mailbox, revealing an envelope.

>take envelope
Taken.

>open envelope
You open the envelope, revealing a letter and a pendant.

>read letter
This note reads: 
"Dear Master. Please forgive me. My health prevents me from aiding you in your battle against the evil one. You teach your students well; they become too powerful for their own good. Enclosed is an amulet that should look familiar. Wear this charm and think of me. The undead fear symbology. Still the Evil, my friend; set it free for the sake of the family."

Front Yard
You stand at the front porch of a house. This old, Gothic mansion casts gloomy shadows all around you. A sharp wind cuts through your flesh to chill your bones. The pounding thunder grows louder and more threatening. A curiously-shaped knocker adorns the front door. Flanking the front door is a pair of marble statues. 

You can see an envelope (in which is a letter) and a mailbox (which is empty) here.

>open door
The door creaks open.

>enter

Entrance Hall
As you enter the mansion, the door slams closed behind you. Welcome home. You are inside the mansion's foyer. This is a large and luxurious room, yet it feels strangely oppressive. A hallway lies to the north. Another passage leads east.

Covering most of the floor is a room-sized carpet that displays a pentagram. In the east wall is a brick fireplace. Atop the rug is an expensive-looking wooden chair and a couch. A painting of a snake hangs above the fireplace. A painting of an eagle hangs on the west wall. A bust of a sailor stands on a pedestal by the fireplace.

On the mantelpiece is a kerosene lamp.

>take lamp
Taken.

>x bust
It is the bust of a weathered sailor. The seven seas are etched in his face. It rests heavily on a marble pedestal.

>x painting of snake

>*hmm?obviously they are there; should probably have a description of all identified scenery

Library
This room was designed for deep thought and research. Obviously it was once inhabited by a serious man of letters. The harsh silence in the rest of the house is muted in this room of contemplation. The east wall is completely covered with a bookcase. On the north wall is a framed star chart. A large, well-polished table dominates the middle of the room. Beside the table is an antique globe. The only exit is west.

On the table is an ancient book.

>x star chart
It's a map of the heavens -- a place you've always wanted to visit.

>search star chart
You find nothing of interest.

>x black hole
You see no black hole here.

>x table
The wood of this table glows with a deep, lustrous shine.

>x globe
This antique globe is rusted into position and no longer spins.

>x bookcase
It's a bookcase filled with many fine books. You see the works of Bacon, Poe, Lovecraft, and Nostradamus. Many of the books seem to be hundreds of years old. Many are in ancient languages and are indecipherable to you.

>open table
That's not something you can open.

>search table
On the table is an ancient book.

>open book
(the ancient book)
As you open the ancient book, a tiny scroll slides out.

>take scroll
Taken.

>read scroll
Carefully written in very tiny script is: 
"Thaumaturgy 101 notes:
Casting Spells:
1) Check the meaning of the words.
2) Say the words to the target of your spell. (target, plugh)
3) Chant the words precisely when there is no target. (chant "xyzzy")

Study for the exam!!!"

>*useful addition for this port of the UI!
[Comment recorded.]

>read book
(the ancient book (which is open))
The book is opened to a page which seems to be filled with definitions. The ones that make the most sense to you are: 
"Instantum: Sudden and momentary; here and gone in an instant. 
Illuminaris: A bright, white light. 
Projectum: The propulsion of an entity. 
Spearca: A small flame or spark. 
Specan: To talk, talking. 
Heafod: The head, the skull, etc. 
Magisterium: Mystery. 
Abraxas: It is a magical word: a vehicle through which magic is directed."

Entrance Hall

(first opening the hall door)

Hall
This room is devoid of any aesthetic warmth or beauty. It is purely functional, with no concern for the trivialities of interior design. To the south is the foyer. Two doors go southwest and west. One door goes east. A staircase leads up. A small painting hangs between the two west-facing doors.

>[Comment recorded.]

>u

Upstairs Hallway
The old wooden floorboards creak under your weight. Your creaking footsteps echo through the emptiness of the huge house. Doors lead west, northwest, east, northeast, and southeast. A stuffed fish hangs on the wall at the end of the hallway.

>se
(first opening the closet door)

Storage Closet
This is a good-sized closet with lots of room for bric-a-brac. Several shelves line the walls. A bare light bulb hangs from the ceiling. You can leave the way you came in, to the north-west.

You now have to question the reliability of your eyes. You think you see a somewhat cute, abstract creature with a brass key in its hand prance by. You're not sure whether it's your eyes or your mind playing tricks on you. It could be both.

On the shelf are a filthy bowl, an ashtray, a bottle of No-Ghost, a detergent box, a cardboard box, a thin box, a hatbox, a can of pesticide and a can of spider cider.

A mop leans against the wall.

You can also see a broom and a tarp here.

The gremlin rockets out of the room, waving a brass key.

>take no-ghost
Taken.

>take spider cider
Taken.

>nw

Upstairs Hallway

That was definitely not your imagination. This little creature is definitely running circles around you.

The gremlin scampers off, waving a brass key.

>open no-ghost
As you remove the cap from this small bottle, a foul odor bombards your olfactory senses. The liquid contents of this nearly empty bottle produce a smell similar to that of an injured skunk. It reminds you of the smell of decay that surrounds the house itself.

The loneliness of this abandoned estate makes you long for the company of your little brother. You have seen neither hide nor hair of him in quite a while. He should be somewhere on this estate. You'd better find him.

>sw
(first opening the recroom door)
As you touch the doorknob, a strange woman appears. She is dressed like Scarlett O'Hara and stands with her back to you. You pause in wonder.

>throw no-ghost at woman
You splash the foul-smelling liquid on the head of the over-dressed guest. The liquid seems to burn as it drips over her. She lets out a horrifying scream as she begins to melt helplessly. Suddenly you feel like Dorothy (and her little dog too).

Rec Room
This looks like a room designed for fun and games. It seems out of place on this gloomy estate. To the west is a rustic-looking door. On the east and west walls are some rather ugly paintings. The dining room is to the north. The hallway is to the east.

You can see a chess table, a gramophone and a cabinet here.

>x paintings
You see no paintings here.

>x gramophone
Until now, you had only seen a gramophone in the movies. This record player has no electronic parts. It consists of a crankshaft, a nail of a needle, and a cone-like horn for a speaker. On the platter is a 78 rpm copy (with a MacNifty label) of Rudy Valee singing "Winchester Cathedral".
The gramophone is currently switched off.

>switch gramophone on
As the old Victrola spews out its sounds, a problem occurs within, causing the record to start skipping and soon the old mainspring snaps with a loud "POP". Anyway, that Rudy Vallee sure has a shnazzy sound.

Trophy Room
The walls of this room are lined with the heads of dead animals. A mounted bear stands in a corner. A tiger skin covers the middle of the floor. To the north is a door leading outside. You can go back to the rec room using the door to the east.

You can see a small cage (which is closed and empty) here.

>n
(first opening the back door)

Backyard
This large expanse of backyard reminds you of the "Wizard of Oz". A path leads north across the lawn to three buildings far in the distance.

A strange creature resembling an eye with wings passes in front of you. Did you ever get the feeling that you were being watched?

You can see a flying eye here.

>n

Yard Path
You stand at a four-way intersection of paths. North is a greenhouse. West is an observatory. East is an old chapel.

Greenhouse Entrance
You stand before the entrance to a greenhouse. The glass is covered with what appears to be dust and condensation inside.

>n

Greenhouse
This steel and glass structure must have once housed a multitude of life-forms. Now potted corpses inhabit shallow, clay graves. It seems that living organisms don't do too well on this estate. Whoever lived here must have had a gold touch, but no green thumb.

On the table are a blue pot, a brown pot, a yellow pot, a green pot, a red pot and a white pot.

You can see a watering can here.

>x blue pot
It's a blue pot.
The dead plant in the blue pot has begun to decay. It is covered by a fine white film.

>x brown pot
It's a brown pot.
The brown pot contains a plant skeleton.

>x yellow pot
It's a yellow pot.
Nothing is growing in the parched and thirsty soil contained in the yellow pot.

>x green pot
It's a green pot.
The plant in the green pot is seriously dead.

>x red pot
It's a red pot.
In the red pot, dead wood sticks poke out of rock-hard dirt.

>x white pot
It's a white pot.
In the white pot this dead plant used to be a fern, perhaps.

>take watering can
Taken.

>pour water on yellow pot
You see no water here.

>x watering can
This tin watering can has a long spout for reaching into plants and depositing water at their dirt floors.

You can't go that way.

The evil air that pervades the estate seems to have infiltrated your very being. Your head and chest feel heavy and thick. You find it increasingly difficult to execute your will. For a minute, your thoughts seemed influenced by another mind.

Master Bedroom
This must be the master bedroom. Interesting decor. There is a stale smell about this room, as if it hasn't been opened for years. Along the west wall are a row of photographs and a large wardrobe. Pushed up against the north wall is a large, comfortable-looking bed. Beside it is a floor-standing lamp. The hallway lies east. Another doorway faces south.

You can see a wheelchair and a table (on which are a black diary, a grey candle, a blue bottle (which is empty) and a brown bottle) here.

>sit in wheelchair
You feel just like Lionel Barrymore in "It's a Wonderful Life.". You roll around the room with a cackling laugh. All you need now is some honest, workingman's mortgage to foreclose on.

>get up
You get out of the wheelchair.

>open diary
You open the black diary.

>read diary
This diary is filled with ramblings that you can barely understand. The only meaningful page is the last one:

"I have lost control of Dracan. My star student now fancies himself a master. Though his power is strong, his spirit is weak. He is easily corrupted by the dark spirits of greed and power. My servant, more aware than I, sealed his star in my hingeless box. They're locked away beyond his stare. I've hidden the key, a chair knows where."

>drop diary
Dropped.

>open wardrobe
It seems to be locked.

Master Bathroom
Whoever decorated this bathroom certainly had ecelctic tastes. There is a large granite bathtub at one end of the room and a marble sink at the other. The decor could be described as "African Art Deco". The only exit is north.

You can see a shelf (on which are a yellow bottle, an amber bottle and a red bottle), an African mask, a clay mask, a Mayan mask, a Voodoo doll and two fluffy towels here.

>put watering can in bathtub
You put the watering can into the granite tub.

Bedroom
This room has a strange energy about it. There is a powerful presence in here. You do not feel alone, just insignificant.

Against the north wall is a bed and bedside table. Above the bed is a small reading lamp. Opposite the bed, on the south wall, is a large, abstract painting. On the west wall is a large wardrobe. The hallway is to the east. A small door is in the north wall.

On the bedside table are a red candle and a star diary.

You can also see a bed (on which are a white pillow and a black pillow) here.

"My star is gone, but not lost. Master's servant will pay for his betrayal. The vehicle of my power has not yet served its purpose. When it sets me free, I will have a chance to realize my unlimited potential. The forces of the technological society will be unprepared for the likes of me. I will not be denied. My omnipotence is inevitable."

Bathroom
This bathroom is cold and dark. You can see a white sink and a porcelain bathtub here. There is no toilet. Whoever lived here really did have a mysterious way of doing things. The door is to the south. Your attention is drawn to a strangly-shaped light fixture on the ceiling.

You can see a soft towel, a drain, a laundry hamper and a marble shelf (on which is a bar of soap) here.

>put watering can in bathtub
(the bathtub faucet)
That can't contain things.

You begin to feel a sense of urgency concerning your little brother. You feel that all is not well. Somewhere on this estate he waits for you to come save him. You must get to him in time.

>turn on faucet

This is an impressive sight. You could throw a terrific birthday bash in this room. The odor of stale wine still permeates the air. On the north and south walls are large paintings. Doors lead east to the hallway, north, south, and west.

At this point you begin to worry about your little brother. You were supposed to take care of him, but you have not seen him for hours. You pray that no harm has come to him.

Kitchen
Upon entering the kitchen, you realize that this room is probably the most modern room in the house. After all, it appears to have been remodeled sometime during the 20th century. Small doors head north and south. The dining room is to the east.

On the shelf are a pewter plate, a silver tray, a matchbox, a salami, a kitchen knife, a beater, a baster, a spatula and a thermometer.

Parlor
This parlor has lost its original charm. The cracked, dirty walls are a testament to the estate's state of disrepair. A simple chandelier hangs from the ceiling. An antique chair sits in a corner. In the opposite corner is a large vase of artificial flowers. A veranda can be seen outside to the east. The hallway is to the west.

This room is devoid of any aesthetic warmth or beauty. It is purely functional, with no concern for the trivialities of interior design. To the south is the foyer. Two doors go southwest and west. One door goes east. A staircase leads up. A small painting hangs between the two west-facing doors.

Entrance Hall
You are inside the mansion's foyer. This is a large and luxurious room, yet it feels strangely oppressive. A hallway lies to the north. Another passage leads east.

Covering most of the floor is a room-sized carpet that displays a pentagram. In the east wall is a brick fireplace. Atop the rug is an expensive-looking wooden chair and a couch. A painting of a snake hangs above the fireplace. A painting of an eagle hangs on the west wall. A bust of a sailor stands on a pedestal by the fireplace.

>cut chair with knife
You slash the upholstery of the chair with the little knife and discover a skeleton key.

>take key
Taken.

Many of the voices in your mind are not your own. You begin to feel almost at home here among the undead. To your dismay the other world is beginning to look more attractive to you than this one. Its inhabitants beckon to you, but you are not yet ready to join them. You do not know where you found this final reserve of willpower. It came not a moment too soon; it is almost too late.

The old wooden floorboards creak under your weight. Your creaking footsteps echo through the emptiness of the huge house. Doors lead west, northwest, east, northeast, and southeast. A stuffed fish hangs on the wall at the end of the hallway.

You can see a black diary, a wheelchair and a table (on which are a grey candle, a blue bottle (which is empty) and a brown bottle) here.

Master Bedroom
This must be the master bedroom. Interesting decor. There is a stale smell about this room, as if it hasn't been opened for years. Along the west wall are a row of photographs and a large wardrobe. Pushed up against the north wall is a large, comfortable-looking bed. Beside it is a floor-standing lamp. The hallway lies east. Another doorway faces south.

You still have not found your brother. He needs your help. You cannot suppress the growing sense of foreboding that now overwhelms you.
