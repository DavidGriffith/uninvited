Front Yard
You stand at the front porch of a house. This old, Gothic mansion casts gloomy shadows all around you. A sharp wind cuts through your flesh to chill your bones. The pounding thunder grows louder and more threatening. A curiously-shaped knocker adorns the front door. Flanking the front door is a pair of marble statues. 

You can see a mailbox (which is closed) here.

BOOM! There is a mighty explosion behind you as your car bursts into flames. That will at least save you the cost of a tow. Better try to find your younger brother and have him call a cab instead of a tow truck.

>! Hurrah! That's fixed!

>open mailbox
You open the mailbox, revealing an envelope.

From the sound of distant barking, you figure it must be a very large dog.

>take envelope
Taken.

>open envelope
You open the envelope, revealing a letter and a pendant.

You put the pendant around your neck.

>put envelope into mailbox
You put the envelope into the mailbox.

>open front door
The door creaks open.

Entrance Hall
As you enter the mansion, the door slams closed behind you. Welcome home. You are inside the mansion's foyer. This is a large and luxurious room, yet it feels strangely oppressive. A hallway lies to the north. Another passage leads east.

Covering most of the floor is a room-sized carpet that displays a pentagram. In the east wall is a brick fireplace. Atop the rug is an expensive-looking wooden chair and a couch. A painting of a snake hangs above the fireplace. A painting of an eagle hangs on the west wall. A bust of a sailor stands on a pedestal by the fireplace.

On the mantelpiece is a kerosene lamp.

>take lamp
Taken.

Library
This room was designed for deep thought and research. Obviously it was once inhabited by a serious man of letters. The harsh silence in the rest of the house is muted in this room of contemplation. The east wall is completely covered with a bookcase. On the north wall is a framed star chart. A large, well-polished table dominates the middle of the room. Beside the table is an antique globe. The only exit is west.

On the table are a bronze statue and an ancient book.

>put lamp on table
As you put the kerosene lamp on the table, it emits a faint hum.

>! Won't try the black hole this run.

(first opening the hall door)

Hall
This room is devoid of any aesthetic warmth or beauty. It is purely functional, with no concern for the trivialities of interior design. To the south is the foyer. Two doors go southwest and west. One door goes east. A staircase leads up. A small painting hangs between the two west-facing doors. Near the staircase is a framed sepia-toned photograph with some writing on it.

Lightning from the storm outside intensely illuminates the hall. There is loud thunder quickly following as the storm approaches.

>u

Upstairs Hallway
The old wooden floorboards creak under your weight. Your creaking footsteps echo through the emptiness of the huge house. Doors lead west, northwest, east, northeast, and southeast. A stuffed fish hangs on the wall at the end of the hallway.

(first opening the closet door)

Storage Closet
This is a good-sized closet with lots of room for bric-a-brac. Several shelves line the walls. A bare light bulb hangs from the ceiling. You can leave the way you came in, to the north-west.

You now have to question the reliability of your eyes. You think you see a somewhat cute, abstract creature with a brass key in its hand prance by. You're not sure whether it's your eyes or your mind playing tricks on you. It could be both.

On the shelf are a filthy bowl, an ashtray, a bottle of No-Ghost, a detergent box, a cardboard box, a thin box, a hatbox, a can of pesticide and a can of spider cider.

A mop leans against the wall.

You can also see a broom and a tarp here.

The gremlin skitters away, waving a brass key.

>take no-ghost
Taken.

That was definitely not your imagination. This little creature is definitely running circles around you.

The gremlin scampers off, waving a brass key.

Hall
This room is devoid of any aesthetic warmth or beauty. It is purely functional, with no concern for the trivialities of interior design. To the south is the foyer. Two doors go southwest and west. One door goes east. A staircase leads up. A small painting hangs between the two west-facing doors. Near the staircase is a framed sepia-toned photograph with some writing on it.

(first opening the parlor door)
As you touch the doorknob, a strange woman appears. She is dressed like Scarlett O'Hara and stands with her back to you. You pause in wonder.

>open no-ghost
As you remove the cap from this small bottle, a foul odor bombards your olfactory senses. The liquid contents of this nearly empty bottle produce a smell similar to that of an injured skunk. It reminds you of the smell of decay that surrounds the house itself.

>throw no-ghost at woman
You splash the foul-smelling liquid on the head of the over-dressed guest. The liquid seems to burn as it drips over her. She lets out a horrifying scream as she begins to melt helplessly. Suddenly you feel like Dorothy (and her little dog too).

>! Good that you allow a turn to open the no-ghost; I think the original didn't.

>! So if you hadn't already opened it before coming down, you were toast.

>e

Parlor
This parlor has lost its original charm. The cracked, dirty walls are a testament to the estate's state of disrepair. A simple chandelier hangs from the ceiling. An antique chair sits in a corner. In the opposite corner is a large vase of artificial flowers. A veranda can be seen outside to the east. The hallway is to the west.

You can see a vase (in which are some artificial flowers) here.

>e

Veranda
From here you have a splendid view of the desolate estate.

A large black spider quickly runs by you along the railing.

>spray spider cider on railing
A wide aerosol stream sprays from the "Spider Cider" can. It leaves a wet, sticky film on the railing.

You see the spider continue its trek across the railing. It becomes paralyzed as it comes into contact with the "spider cider". It's not dead, but it's not going anywhere without your help.

>take spider
(the black spider)
Taken.

>drop spider cider
Dropped.

>! I think the original required you to leave and then return to get the spider; this is better.

Dining Room
This is an impressive sight. You could throw a terrific birthday bash in this room. The odor of stale wine still permeates the air. On the north and south walls are large paintings. Doors lead east to the hallway, north, south, and west.

You can see a dining table (on which are a bouquet of flowers, a champagne bottle (which is empty), a pepper mill and a pewter bowl (in which are a banana, a plum and an apple)) here.

The loneliness of this abandoned estate makes you long for the company of your little brother. You have seen neither hide nor hair of him in quite a while. He should be somewhere on this estate. You'd better find him.

Kitchen
Upon entering the kitchen, you realize that this room is probably the most modern room in the house. After all, it appears to have been remodeled sometime during the 20th century. The cabinets are very well-made. Small doors head north and south. The dining room is to the east.

On the counter are a menacing knife, a little knife, a cleaver, a chef knife and a stained cookie jar.

On the pot rack are a frying pan, a nonstick pan, a shiny pan, a sauce pan and a roasting pan.

You can see some cabinets here.

>take chef knife
Taken.

>open cabinet
You open the cabinets, revealing a paintbrush.

Pantry
This pantry smells musty and stuffy. Patches of wallpaper are missing in several spots. This tiny little room does not fit in with the rest of this sprawling palatial estate. A lamp hangs from the ceiling.

On the shelf are a pewter plate, a silver tray, a matchbox, a salami, a kitchen knife, a beater, a baster, a spatula and a thermometer.

You can see a bag of flour, a bag of rice, a bag of sugar and a bag of salt here.

>take matchbox
Taken.

Lightning from the storm outside intensely illuminates the pantry. There is loud thunder quickly following as the storm approaches.

Servant's Bedroom
Whoever had occupied this room must have been quite satisfied with the small accomodations. There is a simple bed, a floor lamp, and a dresser. A small painting hangs on the wall above the bed. This room does not seem quite as untidy as the rest of the house. You see no dust or cobwebs.

On the bed is a little pillow.

On the dresser are a brush and a cologne bottle.

>turn on lamp
As you turn on the lamp, you see the picture on the wall slide to your left, revealing a small niche in the wall.

Your tired eyes are having trouble focusing on the ghostly figure before you. An angry man's spirit hovers, in chains, in front of you. The ghost speaks: "This is my room. Who let you in here?! These are not the Master's things. They're mine. MINE. MINE. MINE...

>throw spider at ghost
The posessive ghost shrieks at the sight of the stunned spider. Flustered and frightened, the spirit dissolves from view, leaving you alone again.

>search niche
In the niche is a dusty journal.

>read journal
"The Master would, or could, not, so I have stolen Dracan's star. He is an evil soul. Unlike the Master, he uses his power for amusement and profit. He is not concerned with spiritual enlightenment. There is no compassion with his power. I grow weak. I am dying. I have hidden the star in Master's special box. It never opens, it has no locks. Dracan's star never discerns. In fire, it freezes. In ice, it burns."

Master Bedroom
This must be the master bedroom. Interesting decor. There is a stale smell about this room, as if it hasn't been opened for years. Along the west wall are a row of photographs and a large wardrobe. Pushed up against the north wall is a large, comfortable-looking bed. Beside it is a floor-standing lamp. The hallway lies east. Another doorway faces south.

You can see a wheelchair and a table (on which are a black diary, a grey candle, a blue bottle (which is empty) and a brown bottle) here.

The evil air that pervades the estate seems to have infiltrated your very being. Your head and chest feel heavy and thick. You find it increasingly difficult to execute your will. For a minute, your thoughts seemed influenced by another mind.

>unlock wardrobe
What do you want to unlock the wardrobe with?

>key
You unlock the wardrobe.

>open wardrobe
You open the wardrobe, revealing a small papyrus scroll, a large papyrus scroll, a wooden box and a golden vial.

Lightning from the storm outside intensely illuminates the master bedroom. There is loud thunder quickly following as the storm approaches.

>read small scroll
"Together these form a key: berkelium, rhodium, and silver".

>read large scroll
"The heart of the garden maze contains the Blothney Gem. There are certain places you cannot go, 'till you unlock the 'mystery'".

Taken.

Loud thunder echoes all around you as the storm outside intensifies.

That's better. The dry firewood quickly catches fire. Now it's not so chilly.

>put wooden box on wood
As you toss the box into the fire, a large thick, puff of smoke jumps out. As the smoke clears you notice a brass pentagram that apparently survived the burning of the box has jumped out as well.

Taken.

Loud thunder echoes all around you as the storm outside intensifies.

Rec Room
This looks like a room designed for fun and games. It seems out of place on this gloomy estate. To the west is a rustic-looking door. On the east and west walls are some rather ugly paintings. The dining room is to the north. The hallway is to the east.

You can see a chess table, a gramophone and a cabinet here.

>open cabinet
It seems to be locked.

You begin to feel a sense of urgency concerning your little brother. You feel that all is not well. Somewhere on this estate he waits for you to come save him. You must get to him in time.

>unlock cabinet with key
You unlock the cabinet.

>open cabinet
You open the cabinet, revealing a gypsy doll.

>doll, "specan heafod abraxas"
The doll says "Talk to my pious brother. He can help you find yours. A word from him can open doors in high places."

>! Nice clue for chapel! I think you added this, or else I never noticed it before in the original. Very good!

>turn on gramophone
As the old Victrola spews out its sounds, a problem occurs within, causing the record to start skipping and soon the old mainspring snaps with a loud "POP". Anyway, that Rudy Vallee sure has a shnazzy sound.

>! This would be a nice spot for sound if you add 'em.

Trophy Room
The walls of this room are lined with the heads of dead animals. A mounted bear stands in a corner. A tiger skin covers the middle of the floor. To the north is a door leading outside. You can go back to the rec room using the door to the east.

You can see a small cage (which is closed and empty) here.

(first opening the back door)

Backyard
This large expanse of backyard reminds you of the "Wizard of Oz". A path leads north across the lawn to three buildings far in the distance.

A strange creature resembling an eye with wings passes in front of you. Did you ever get the feeling that you were being watched?

You can see a flying eye here.

The flying eye flutters away.

Greenhouse
This steel and glass structure must have once housed a multitude of life-forms. Now potted corpses inhabit shallow, clay graves. It seems that living organisms don't do too well on this estate. Whoever lived here must have had a gold touch, but no green thumb.

On the table are a blue pot, a brown pot, a yellow pot, a green pot, a red pot and a white pot.

You can see a watering can (in which is some water) here.

Bedroom
This room has a strange energy about it. There is a powerful presence in here. You do not feel alone, just insignificant.

Against the north wall is a bed and bedside table. Above the bed is a small reading lamp. Opposite the bed, on the south wall, is a large, abstract painting. On the west wall is a large wardrobe. The hallway is to the east. A small door is in the north wall.

On the bedside table are a red candle and a star diary.

You can also see a bed (on which are a white pillow and a black pillow) here.

Bathroom
This bathroom is cold and dark. You can see a white sink and a porcelain bathtub here. There is no toilet. Whoever lived here really did have a mysterious way of doing things. The door is to the south. Your attention is drawn to a strangly-shaped light fixture on the ceiling.

You can see a drain, two towels, a laundry hamper and a marble shelf (on which is a bar of soap) here.

Lightning from the storm outside intensely illuminates the bathroom. There is loud thunder quickly following as the storm approaches.

This must be the master bedroom. Interesting decor. There is a stale smell about this room, as if it hasn't been opened for years. Along the west wall are a row of photographs and a large wardrobe. Pushed up against the north wall is a large, comfortable-looking bed. Beside it is a floor-standing lamp. The hallway lies east. Another doorway faces south.

You can see a wheelchair and a table (on which are a black diary, a grey candle, a blue bottle (which is empty) and a brown bottle) here.

>read diary
This diary is filled with ramblings that you can barely understand. The only meaningful page is the last one:

"I have lost control of Dracan. My star student now fancies himself a master. Though his power is strong, his spirit is weak. He is easily corrupted by the dark spirits of greed and power. My servant, more aware than I, sealed his star in my hingeless box. They're locked away beyond his stare. I've hidden the key, a chair knows where."

Hall
This room is devoid of any aesthetic warmth or beauty. It is purely functional, with no concern for the trivialities of interior design. To the south is the foyer. Two doors go southwest and west. One door goes east. A staircase leads up. A small painting hangs between the two west-facing doors. Near the staircase is a framed sepia-toned photograph with some writing on it.

Rec Room
This looks like a room designed for fun and games. It seems out of place on this gloomy estate. To the west is a rustic-looking door. On the east and west walls are some rather ugly paintings. The dining room is to the north. The hallway is to the east.

You can see a chess table, a gramophone and a cabinet (in which is a gypsy doll) here.

Chapel
You stand in solemn awe in this abandoned house of worship. In the silence you can hear the prayers of righteous predecessors. You feel the presence of many long-dead worshippers. You feel yourself a stranger, yet you feel protected. Beside the altar is a statue upon a pedestal. In the east wall, beside the altar is a beautiful and very large stained glass window. There is a heavy-looking side door in the north wall, which is closed.

Church Grounds
You are standing on a path that leads up to a large stone structure. Beyond the structure you see a forest that looks as if it has been ravaged by decay.

As you leave the chapel, a strange ghost flies over you. It does not attack you. The glow of the candle dims the presence of the ghost. It is offended by the flame and flies off to its supernatural home.

Rec Room
This looks like a room designed for fun and games. It seems out of place on this gloomy estate. To the west is a rustic-looking door. On the east and west walls are some rather ugly paintings. The dining room is to the north. The hallway is to the east.

You can see a chess table, a gramophone and a cabinet (in which is a gypsy doll) here.

Dining Room
This is an impressive sight. You could throw a terrific birthday bash in this room. The odor of stale wine still permeates the air. On the north and south walls are large paintings. Doors lead east to the hallway, north, south, and west.

Study
You're in a small study. A small desk squats in the middle of the room. To the east is a door. To the south is the dining room.

Brrrr. There is no central heating in this old Gothic mansion. The curved outer wall of this room is exposed to the elements in three directions. It is colder in here than it is outside, and there is no fireplace. It must be awful during the winter.

On the desk is a blotter.

>read blotter
Remembering a certain detective novel, you look at the blotter at an angle to better read what might have been written on papers resting upon it. You are ultimately unable to read anything and you don't have a pencil to make it easier.

Loud thunder echoes all around you as the storm outside intensifies.

>open desk
You open the drawer in the desk revealing a notebook.

>read notebook
Flipping through the notebook, you see that each page contains a brief handwritten description of each of the chemical elements. It seems to end with "einsteinium". You close the notebook.

(If you want to read about a specific element, just do something like "READ ABOUT CARBON".)

>! Excellent!

A strange, hideous creature stares at you.

>! Hmm?looks like the kid has disappeared from the game. Not sure how to test for this.

>! I think that this must be a bug, so I'm going to see if I can get into the black hole and out again.

>x star chart
It's a map of the heavens -- a place you've always wanted to visit.

>x table
The wood of this table glows with a deep, lustrous shine.

>take lamp
Taken.

>put lamp on table
As you put the kerosene lamp on the table, it emits a faint hum.

>x star chart
It's a map of the heavens -- a place you've always wanted to visit. You notice a very odd looking star on this chart that you didn't notice before.

>odd star, "specan heafod abraxas"
The star, doesn't say anything, but you now realize you're looking at a black hole.

>x black hole
It look a lot of very powerful magic to retain an actual reduced version of a real black hole here on this star map in this old mansion -- probably an even greater amount to transport it here.

>enter black hole
Suddenly you experience a feeling quite unlike anything you've ever experienced before. Time and space as you know it are now foreign concepts. You feel what you think is a tremendous acceleration toward the black hole, but you don't know for sure what is happening to you. You're not sure if this experience will ever end. Then suddenly...

The Art Gallery

In the Art Gallery you can see a Greek urn, a Greek bowl, a Greek plate, a painting of a siren, a painting of an emperor and an onyx key.

>x urn
This actual 3000 year old Greek urn shows paintings and designs of different activities. Ever wonder why they NEVER showed any fat people? Were all the ancient Greeks thin as rails?

>x siren
The sultry and languid siren that adorns this canvas reminds you of some of Rembrandt's works. As you look into her eyes, you are drawn by her beconing gaze.

Lightning from the storm outside intensely illuminates the library. There is loud thunder quickly following as the storm approaches.

>! Dang, forgot the paintbrush

>! Noises from the world still penetrate the black hole.

>x grafitti
You see no grafitti here.

>! ooops

>x graffiti
The graffiti is composed of a crude drawing of a man in obvious distress and some writing. It reads:

"When I first arrived here, it was all in black and white. Now all I see are words. If I remember correctly, I put the two lamps on top of each other, closed my inventory, examined the black hole, opened it, closed it, talked to it, then walked through. Then I found myself here. -- Stan Kaufman

>! ;-)

>exit black hole
I only understood you as far as wanting to exit the onyx key.

>go through black hole
You can't see any such thing.

>exit art gallery
You see no art gallery here.

>enter library
You see no library here.

>n
You can't go that way.

At this point you begin to worry about your little brother. You were supposed to take care of him, but you have not seen him for hours. You pray that no harm has come to him.

>s
You can't go that way.

>e
You can't go that way.

>
I beg your pardon?

>w
You can't go that way.

>out
You get out of the Art Gallery.
