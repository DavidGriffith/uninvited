>open door
You open the car door.
You smell leaking gasoline.

>get out of car

Front Yard
You stand at the front porch of a house. This old, Gothic mansion casts gloomy shadows all around you. A sharp wind cuts through your flesh to chill your bones. The pounding thunder grows louder and more threatening. A curiously-shaped knocker adorns the front door. Flanking the front door is a pair of marble statues. 

You can see a mailbox (which is closed) here.

BOOM! There is a mighty explosion behind you as your car bursts into flames. That will at least save you the cost of a tow. Better try to find your younger brother and have him call a cab instead of a tow truck.

>open mailbox
You open the mailbox, revealing an envelope.

>open envelope
You open the envelope, revealing a letter and a pendant.

>take pendant
Taken.

>wear pendant
You put the pendant around your neck.

>open door
The front door creaks open.

Entrance Hall
As you enter the mansion, the door slams closed behind you. Welcome home. You are inside the mansion's foyer. This is a large and luxurious room, yet it feels strangely oppressive. A hallway lies to the north. Another passage leads east.

Covering most of the floor is a room-sized carpet that displays a pentagram. In the east wall is a brick fireplace. Atop the rug is an expensive-looking wooden chair and a couch. A painting of a snake hangs above the fireplace. A painting of an eagle hangs on the west wall. A bust of a sailor stands on a pedestal by the fireplace.

On the mantelpiece is a kerosene lamp.

You now have to question the reliability of your eyes. You think you see a somewhat cute, abstract creature with a brass key in its hand prance by. You're not sure whether it's your eyes or your mind playing tricks on you. It could be both.

(first opening the hall door)

Hall
This room is devoid of any aesthetic warmth or beauty. It is purely functional, with no concern for the trivialities of interior design. To the south is the foyer. Two doors go southwest and west. One door goes east. A staircase leads up. A small painting hangs between the two west-facing doors. Near the staircase is a framed sepia-toned photograph with some writing on it.

>u

Upstairs Hallway
The old wooden floorboards creak under your weight. Your creaking footsteps echo through the emptiness of the huge house. Doors lead west, northwest, east, northeast, and southeast. A stuffed fish hangs on the wall at the end of the hallway.

(first opening the closet door)

Storage Closet
This is a good-sized closet with lots of room for bric-a-brac. Several shelves line the walls. A bare light bulb hangs from the ceiling. You can leave the way you came in, to the north-west.

On the shelf are a filthy bowl, an ashtray, a bottle of No-Ghost, a detergent box, a cardboard box, a thin box, a hatbox, a can of pesticide and a can of spider cider.

A mop leans against the wall.

You can also see a broom and a tarp here.

>take no-ghost, spider cider
bottle of No-Ghost: Taken.
can of spider cider: Taken.

Loud thunder echoes all around you as the storm outside intensifies.

>open no-ghost
As you remove the cap from this small bottle, a foul odor bombards your olfactory senses. The liquid contents of this nearly empty bottle produce a smell similar to that of an injured skunk. It reminds you of the smell of decay that surrounds the house itself.

That was definitely not your imagination. This little creature is definitely running circles around you.

The gremlin prances away, waving a brass key.

(first opening the parlor door)
As you touch the doorknob, a strange woman appears. She is dressed like Scarlett O'Hara and stands with her back to you. You pause in wonder.

The kiddie creature runs past waving his brass key. The way he runs around he must get very hungry. This little devil must eat something that makes him awfully hyper.

>throw no-ghost at woman
You splash the foul-smelling liquid on the head of the over-dressed guest. The liquid seems to burn as it drips over her. She lets out a horrifying scream as she begins to melt helplessly. Suddenly you feel like Dorothy (and her little dog too).

The gremlin rockets out of the room, waving a brass key.

You're carrying:
  a can of spider cider
  a pendant (being worn)

Parlor
This parlor has lost its original charm. The cracked, dirty walls are a testament to the estate's state of disrepair. A simple chandelier hangs from the ceiling. An antique chair sits in a corner. In the opposite corner is a large vase of artificial flowers. A veranda can be seen outside to the east. The hallway is to the west.

You can see a vase (in which are some artificial flowers) here.

>e

Veranda
From here you have a splendid view of the desolate estate.

A large black spider quickly runs by you along the railing.

>spray spider cider on railing
A wide aerosol stream sprays from the "Spider Cider" can. It leaves a wet, sticky film on the railing.

You see the spider continue its trek across the railing. It becomes paralyzed as it comes into contact with the "spider cider". It's not dead, but it's not going anywhere without your help.

>take spider
(the black spider)
Taken.

>drop spider cider
Dropped.

Dining Room
This is an impressive sight. You could throw a terrific birthday bash in this room. The odor of stale wine still permeates the air. On the north and south walls are large paintings. Doors lead east to the hallway, north, south, and west.

You can see a dining table (on which are a bouquet of flowers, a champagne bottle (which is empty), a pepper mill and a pewter bowl (in which are a banana, a plum and an apple)) here.

>take bouquet
Taken.

>n

Study
You're in a small study. A small desk squats in the middle of the room. To the east is a door. To the south is the dining room.

Brrrr. There is no central heating in this old Gothic mansion. The curved outer wall of this room is exposed to the elements in three directions. It is colder in here than it is outside, and there is no fireplace. It must be awful during the winter.

On the desk is a blotter.

>open desk
You open the drawer in the desk revealing a notebook.

>open notebook
Flipping through the notebook, you see that each page contains a brief handwritten description of each of the chemical elements. It seems to end with "einsteinium". You close the notebook.

(If you want to read about a specific element, just do something like "READ ABOUT CARBON IN THE NOTEBOOK".)

Kitchen
Upon entering the kitchen, you realize that this room is probably the most modern room in the house. After all, it appears to have been remodeled sometime during the 20th century. The cabinets are very well-made. Small doors head north and south. The dining room is to the east.

On the counter are a menacing knife, a little knife, a cleaver, a chef knife and a stained cookie jar.

On the pot rack are a frying pan, a nonstick pan, a shiny pan, a sauce pan and a roasting pan.

You can see some cabinets here.

>take chef knife
Taken.

The loneliness of this abandoned estate makes you long for the company of your little brother. You have seen neither hide nor hair of him in quite a while. He should be somewhere on this estate. You'd better find him.

>open cabinet
You open the cabinets, revealing a paintbrush.

>take paintbrush
Taken.

Ok.

Servant's Bedroom
Whoever had occupied this room must have been quite satisfied with the small accomodations. There is a simple bed, a floor lamp, and a dresser. A small painting hangs on the wall above the bed. This room does not seem quite as untidy as the rest of the house. You see no dust or cobwebs.

On the bed is a little pillow.

On the dresser are a brush and a cologne bottle.

>turn on lamp
As you turn on the lamp, you see the picture on the wall slide to your left, revealing a small niche in the wall.

Your tired eyes are having trouble focusing on the ghostly figure before you. An angry man's spirit hovers, in chains, in front of you. The ghost speaks: "This is my room. Who let you in here?! These are not the Master's things. They're mine. MINE. MINE. MINE...

>give spider to ghost
The posessive ghost shrieks at the sight of the stunned spider. Flustered and frightened, the spirit dissolves from view, leaving you alone again.

>search niche
In the niche is a dusty journal.

>read journal
"The Master would, or could, not, so I have stolen Dracan's star. He is an evil soul. Unlike the Master, he uses his power for amusement and profit. He is not concerned with spiritual enlightenment. There is no compassion with his power. I grow weak. I am dying. I have hidden the star in Master's special box. It never opens, it has no locks. Dracan's star never discerns. In fire, it freezes. In ice, it burns."

Pantry
This pantry smells musty and stuffy. Patches of wallpaper are missing in several spots. This tiny little room does not fit in with the rest of this sprawling palatial estate. A lamp hangs from the ceiling.

On the shelf are a pewter plate, a silver tray, a matchbox, a salami, a kitchen knife, a beater, a baster, a spatula and a thermometer.

You can see a bag of flour, a bag of rice, a bag of sugar and a bag of salt here.

Taken.

Master Bedroom
This must be the master bedroom. Interesting decor. There is a stale smell about this room, as if it hasn't been opened for years. Along the west wall are a row of photographs and a large wardrobe. Pushed up against the north wall is a large, comfortable-looking bed. Beside it is a floor-standing lamp. The hallway lies east. Another doorway faces south.

You can see a wheelchair and a table (on which are a black diary, a grey candle, a blue bottle (which is empty) and a brown bottle) here.

>unlock wardrobe with key
You unlock the wardrobe.

>open wardrobe
You open the wardrobe, revealing a small papyrus scroll, a large papyrus scroll, a wooden box and a golden vial.

The evil air that pervades the estate seems to have infiltrated your very being. Your head and chest feel heavy and thick. You find it increasingly difficult to execute your will. For a minute, your thoughts seemed influenced by another mind.

>read small scroll
"Together these form a key: lithium, molybdenum, and neodymium".

>read large scroll
"The heart of the garden maze contains the Blothney Gem. There are certain places you cannot go, 'till you unlock the 'mystery'".

You open the matchbox, revealing six matches.

>take match
Taken.

>strike match on matchbox
The blue tip on this short stick bursts into flame.

>put match on wood
That's better. The dry firewood quickly catches fire. Now it's not so chilly.

>put wooden box on fire
As you toss the box into the fire, a large thick, puff of smoke jumps out. As the smoke clears you notice a brass pentagram that apparently survived the burning of the box has jumped out as well.

>take pentagram

Library
This room was designed for deep thought and research. Obviously it was once inhabited by a serious man of letters. The harsh silence in the rest of the house is muted in this room of contemplation. The east wall is completely covered with a bookcase. On the north wall is a framed star chart. A large, well-polished table dominates the middle of the room. Beside the table is an antique globe. The only exit is west.

On the table are a bronze statue and an ancient book.

>open book
(the ancient book)
As you open the ancient book, a tiny scroll slides out.

>read scroll
Carefully written in very tiny script is: 
"Thaumaturgy 101 notes:
Casting Spells:
1) Check the meaning of the words.
2) Say the words to the target of your spell. (target, plugh)
3) Chant the words precisely when there is no target. (chant "xyzzy")

Study for the exam!!!
" 
On the back is some scrawl that reads, "What happened to my notebook? I need to to LOOK UP some chemical elements."

>read book
(the ancient book (which is open))
The book is opened to a page which seems to be filled with definitions. The ones that make the most sense to you are: 
"Instantum: Sudden and momentary; here and gone in an instant. 
Illuminaris: A bright, white light. 
Projectum: The propulsion of an entity. 
Spearca: A small flame or spark. 
Specan: To talk, talking. 
Heafod: The head, the skull, etc. 
Magisterium: Mystery. 
Abraxas: It is a magical word: a vehicle through which magic is directed."

>statue, specan heafod abraxas
The statue trembles and utters the words "What? I didn't say anything!"

>put lamp on table
As you put the kerosene lamp on the table, it emits a faint hum.

Loud thunder echoes all around you as the storm outside intensifies.

>x star chart
It's a map of the heavens -- a place you've always wanted to visit.

>take lamp
Taken.

>put lamp on table
As you put the kerosene lamp on the table, it emits a faint hum.

>x star chart
It's a map of the heavens -- a place you've always wanted to visit. You notice a very odd looking star on this chart that you didn't notice before.

You begin to feel a sense of urgency concerning your little brother. You feel that all is not well. Somewhere on this estate he waits for you to come save him. You must get to him in time.

Loud thunder echoes all around you as the storm outside intensifies.

>! Hmm?if you put the lamp on the table before you examine the star chart, you don't see the black hole.

>! You have to examine the star chart first, not see the black hole, THEN put the lamp on the table.

>! Seems unlikely that anyone will stumble into this without a hint.

>! Then again, the original easter egg was impossible without being told, too.
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>specan heafod abraxas
That's not a verb I recognize.

>odd star, specan heafod abraxas
The star, doesn't say anything, but you now realize you're looking at a black hole.

>x black hole
It look a lot of very powerful magic to retain an actual reduced version of a real black hole here on this star map in this old mansion -- probably an even greater amount to transport it here.

>enter black hole
Suddenly you experience a feeling quite unlike anything you've ever experienced before. Time and space as you know it are now foreign concepts. You feel what you think is a tremendous acceleration toward the black hole, but you don't know for sure what is happening to you. You're not sure if this experience will ever end. Then suddenly...

The Art Gallery

In the Art Gallery you can see a Greek urn, a Greek bowl, a Greek plate, a painting of a siren, a painting of an emperor and an onyx key.

>i
You're carrying:
  a brass pentagram
  a skeleton key
  a matchbox (which is open)
    five matches
  a paintbrush
  a bouquet of flowers
  a pendant (being worn)

>x urn
This actual 3000 year old Greek urn shows paintings and designs of different activities. Ever wonder why they NEVER showed any fat people? Were all the ancient Greeks thin as rails?

>x bowl
This bowl probably was used in an ancient Athenian temple during rush hour, as an incense holder. That, or the ancient Greeks ate some really HOT cereal, as evidenced by the burn-marks on its bottom

>x plate
The same motif as the urn and the bowl adorn this plate.

>x siren
The sultry and languid siren that adorns this canvas reminds you of some of Rembrandt's works. As you look into her eyes, you are drawn by her beckoning gaze.

>paint siren with paintbrush
That's not a verb I recognize.

>use paintbrush on siren
You add a few touches to the painting, transforming it into a true work of art. It seems pretty obvious what you think is beautiful.

>x siren
The siren that looked so good before, looks even better with less clothing. Your mind begins to wander... and so does your attention.

>! Nice.

>drop paintbrush
Dropped.

>x graffiti
The graffiti is composed of a crude drawing of a man in obvious distress and some writing. It reads:

"When I first arrived here, it was all in black and white. Now all I see are words. If I remember correctly, I put the two lamps on top of each other, closed my inventory, examined the black hole, opened it, closed it, talked to it, then walked through. Then I found myself here. -- Stan Kaufman"

>! Very nice; thanks!
