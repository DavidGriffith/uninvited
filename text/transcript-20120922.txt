>open door
You open the car door.
You smell leaking gasoline.

But you aren't in the car door.
You smell leaking gasoline.

Front Yard
You stand at the front porch of a house. This old, Gothic mansion casts gloomy shadows all around you. A sharp wind cuts through your flesh to chill your bones. The pounding thunder grows louder and more threatening. A curiously-shaped knocker adorns the front door. Flanking the front door is a pair of marble statues. 

You can see a mailbox (which is closed) here.

BOOM! There is a mighty explosion behind you as your car bursts into flames. That will at least save you the cost of a tow. Better try to find your younger brother and have him call a cab instead of a tow truck.

>open door
The door creaks open.

>n

Entrance Hall
As you enter the mansion, the door slams closed behind you. Welcome home. You are inside the mansion's foyer. This is a large and luxurious room, yet it feels strangely oppressive. A hallway lies to the north. Another passage leads east.

Covering most of the floor is a room-sized carpet that displays a pentagram. In the east wall is a brick fireplace. Atop the rug is an expensive-looking wooden chair and a couch. A painting of a snake hangs above the fireplace. A painting of an eagle hangs on the west wall. A bust of a sailor stands on a pedestal by the fireplace.

On the mantelpiece is a kerosene lamp.

Loud thunder echoes all around you as the storm outside intensifies.

>take lamp
Taken.

Library
This room was designed for deep thought and research. Obviously it was once inhabited by a serious man of letters. The harsh silence in the rest of the house is muted in this room of contemplation. The east wall is completely covered with a bookcase. On the north wall is a framed star chart. A large, well-polished table dominates the middle of the room. Beside the table is an antique globe. The only exit is west.

On the table are a bronze statue and an ancient book.

Loud thunder echoes all around you as the storm outside intensifies.

>open book
(the ancient book)
As you open the ancient book, a tiny scroll slides out.

>take scroll
Taken.

>read scroll
Carefully written in very tiny script is: 
"Thaumaturgy 101 notes:
Casting Spells:
1) Check the meaning of the words.
2) Say the words to the target of your spell. (target, plugh)
3) Chant the words precisely when there is no target. (chant "xyzzy")

Study for the exam!!!"

>drop scroll
Dropped.

>read book
(the ancient book (which is open))
The book is opened to a page which seems to be filled with definitions. The ones that make the most sense to you are: 
"Instantum: Sudden and momentary; here and gone in an instant. 
Illuminaris: A bright, white light. 
Projectum: The propulsion of an entity. 
Spearca: A small flame or spark. 
Specan: To talk, talking. 
Heafod: The head, the skull, etc. 
Magisterium: Mystery. 
Abraxas: It is a magical word: a vehicle through which magic is directed."

>x globe
This antique globe is rusted into position and no longer spins.

(first opening the hall door)

Hall
This room is devoid of any aesthetic warmth or beauty. It is purely functional, with no concern for the trivialities of interior design. To the south is the foyer. Two doors go southwest and west. One door goes east. A staircase leads up. A small painting hangs between the two west-facing doors. Near the staircase is a framed sepia-toned photograph with some writing on it.

Loud thunder echoes all around you as the storm outside intensifies.

>x painting
It looks like a still reproduced from F. W Murnau's film, "Nosferatu". There seems to be a familiar face in the background. On closer examination it appears to be Dave Feldman, whose wit and insight was a valuable asset in the creation of "Uninvited".

>! Still think you should put another painting here with you and some quip about how you preserved "Uninvited."

>u

Upstairs Hallway
The old wooden floorboards creak under your weight. Your creaking footsteps echo through the emptiness of the huge house. Doors lead west, northwest, east, northeast, and southeast. A stuffed fish hangs on the wall at the end of the hallway.

>se
(first opening the closet door)

Storage Closet
This is a good-sized closet with lots of room for bric-a-brac. Several shelves line the walls. A bare light bulb hangs from the ceiling. You can leave the way you came in, to the north-west.

You now have to question the reliability of your eyes. You think you see a somewhat cute, abstract creature with a brass key in its hand prance by. You're not sure whether it's your eyes or your mind playing tricks on you. It could be both.

On the shelf are a filthy bowl, an ashtray, a bottle of No-Ghost, a detergent box, a cardboard box, a thin box, a hatbox, a can of pesticide and a can of spider cider.

A mop leans against the wall.

You can also see a broom and a tarp here.

The gremlin zooms away, waving a brass key.

>take no-ghost

That was definitely not your imagination. This little creature is definitely running circles around you.

(first opening the parlor door)
As you touch the doorknob, a strange woman appears. She is dressed like Scarlett O'Hara and stands with her back to you. You pause in wonder.

>throw no-ghost at woman
You have gotten the attention of the mysterious lady. She turns to face you. Her face is devoid of any flesh. You are frozen with horror as she begins ripping your body into a bloody mess.


    *** You have died ***


Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game or QUIT?
> undo
Hall
[Previous turn undone.]

>open no-ghost
As you remove the cap from this small bottle, a foul odor bombards your olfactory senses. The liquid contents of this nearly empty bottle produce a smell similar to that of an injured skunk. It reminds you of the smell of decay that surrounds the house itself.

>throw no-ghost at woman
You splash the foul-smelling liquid on the head of the over-dressed guest. The liquid seems to burn as it drips over her. She lets out a horrifying scream as she begins to melt helplessly. Suddenly you feel like Dorothy (and her little dog too).

>e

Parlor
This parlor has lost its original charm. The cracked, dirty walls are a testament to the estate's state of disrepair. A simple chandelier hangs from the ceiling. An antique chair sits in a corner. In the opposite corner is a large vase of artificial flowers. A veranda can be seen outside to the east. The hallway is to the west.

You can see a vase (in which are some artificial flowers) here.

>e

Veranda
From here you have a splendid view of the desolate estate.

A large black spider quickly runs by you along the railing.

>spray spider cider on railing
A wide aerosol stream sprays from the "Spider Cider" can. It leaves a wet, sticky film on the railing.

You see the spider continue its trek across the railing. It becomes paralyzed as it comes into contact with the "spider cider". It's not dead, but it's not going anywhere without your help.

>take spider

Taken.

From the sound of distant barking, you figure it must be a very large dog.

Dining Room
This is an impressive sight. You could throw a terrific birthday bash in this room. The odor of stale wine still permeates the air. On the north and south walls are large paintings. Doors lead east to the hallway, north, south, and west.

You can see a dining table (on which are a bouquet of flowers, a champagne bottle (which is empty), a pepper mill and a pewter bowl (in which are a banana, a plum and an apple)) here.

You see no boquet here.

Kitchen
Upon entering the kitchen, you realize that this room is probably the most modern room in the house. After all, it appears to have been remodeled sometime during the 20th century. The cabinets are very well-made. Small doors head north and south. The dining room is to the east.

On the counter are a menacing knife, a little knife, a cleaver, a chef knife and a stained cookie jar.

On the pot rack are a frying pan, a nonstick pan, a shiny pan, a sauce pan and a roasting pan.

You can see some cabinets here.

>take menacing knife
Taken.

The loneliness of this abandoned estate makes you long for the company of your little brother. You have seen neither hide nor hair of him in quite a while. He should be somewhere on this estate. You'd better find him.

Master Bedroom
This must be the master bedroom. Interesting decor. There is a stale smell about this room, as if it hasn't been opened for years. Along the west wall are a row of photographs and a large wardrobe. Pushed up against the north wall is a large, comfortable-looking bed. Beside it is a floor-standing lamp. The hallway lies east. Another doorway faces south.

You can see a wheelchair and a table (on which are a black diary, a grey candle, a blue bottle (which is empty) and a brown bottle) here.

Lightning from the storm outside intensely illuminates the master bedroom. There is loud thunder quickly following as the storm approaches.

>read diary
This diary is filled with ramblings that you can barely understand. The only meaningful page is the last one:

"I have lost control of Dracan. My star student now fancies himself a master. Though his power is strong, his spirit is weak. He is easily corrupted by the dark spirits of greed and power. My servant, more aware than I, sealed his star in my hingeless box. They're locked away beyond his stare. I've hidden the key, a chair knows where."

>unlock wardrobe with key
You unlock the wardrobe.

>open wardrobe
You open the wardrobe, revealing a small papyrus scroll, a large papyrus scroll, a wooden box and a golden vial.

>read small scroll

Master Bathroom
Whoever decorated this bathroom certainly had ecelctic tastes. There is a large granite bathtub at one end of the room and a marble sink at the other. The decor could be described as "African Art Deco". The only exit is north.

You can see a shelf (on which are a yellow bottle, an amber bottle and a red bottle), an African mask, a clay mask, a Mayan mask, a Voodoo doll and two towels here.

>african mask, specan heafod abraxas
You can't talk to the African mask.

Bedroom
This room has a strange energy about it. There is a powerful presence in here. You do not feel alone, just insignificant.

Against the north wall is a bed and bedside table. Above the bed is a small reading lamp. Opposite the bed, on the south wall, is a large, abstract painting. On the west wall is a large wardrobe. The hallway is to the east. A small door is in the north wall.

On the bedside table are a red candle and a star diary.

You can also see a bed (on which are a white pillow and a black pillow) here.

>read diary
Several pages are torn out. The only remaining page with writing on it reads:

"My star is gone, but not lost. Master's servant will pay for his betrayal. The vehicle of my power has not yet served its purpose. When it sets me free, I will have a chance to realize my unlimited potential. The forces of the technological society will be unprepared for the likes of me. I will not be denied. My omnipotence is inevitable."

Bathroom
This bathroom is cold and dark. You can see a white sink and a porcelain bathtub here. There is no toilet. Whoever lived here really did have a mysterious way of doing things. The door is to the south. Your attention is drawn to a strangly-shaped light fixture on the ceiling.

You can see two rocks, two towels, a drain, a laundry hamper and a marble shelf (on which is a bar of soap) here.

Study
You're in a small study. A small desk squats in the middle of the room. To the east is a door. To the south is the dining room.

Brrrr. There is no central heating in this old Gothic mansion. The curved outer wall of this room is exposed to the elements in three directions. It is colder in here than it is outside, and there is no fireplace. It must be awful during the winter.

On the desk is a blotter.

>x blotter
This ink blotter is marked with the lines of many letters. Fine indentations criss-cross the surface of the blotter.

>read blotter
The blotter doesn't seem to bear any writing.

>open desk
You open the drawer in the desk revealing a notebook.

Loud thunder echoes all around you as the storm outside intensifies.

>read notebook
Flipping through the notebook, you see that each page contains a brief handwritten description of each of the chemical elements. It seems to end with "einsteinium". You close the notebook.

>read first page
You see no first page here.

>search for potassium in notebook
You can't see any such thing.

>open notebook to potassium
I only understood you as far as wanting to open the notebook.

>open notebook
Flipping through the notebook, you see that each page contains a brief handwritten description of each of the chemical elements. It seems to end with "einsteinium". You close the notebook.

The evil air that pervades the estate seems to have infiltrated your very being. Your head and chest feel heavy and thick. You find it increasingly difficult to execute your will. For a minute, your thoughts seemed influenced by another mind.

>find potassium in notebook
That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine notebook for potassium
I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the notebook.

>! to find the atomic weight of the elements -- and thus the combination.

>! If you're using the same schema here, the player will have to go outside the game to look

>! up the atomic weights of the randomized elements -- which shouldn't be necessary.

>! And here's my comment from back on the Veranda about the spider:
That's not a verb I recognize.

>! Seems that no-ghost and spider cider should both have to be opened to use them, or neither should 

>! -- not as now where no-ghost has to be opened but spider cider doesn't.

>! And here's my comment from the Study about the blotter
That's not a verb I recognize.

>! This suggests that the PC should rub a pencil on the blotter (ala "Deadline") to uncover a message, but

>! this wasn't in the original and I presume you haven't added something here. Nice red herring, though.

>! No clue why the parser seems to want to try to recognize a verb in response to some of these comments.

Pantry
This pantry smells musty and stuffy. Patches of wallpaper are missing in several spots. This tiny little room does not fit in with the rest of this sprawling palatial estate. A lamp hangs from the ceiling.

On the shelf are a pewter plate, a silver tray, a matchbox, a salami, a kitchen knife, a beater, a baster, a spatula and a thermometer.

You can see a bag of flour, a bag of rice, a bag of sugar and a bag of salt here.

Bedroom
Whoever had occupied this room must have been quite satisfied with the small accomodations. There is a simple bed, a floor lamp, and a dresser. A small painting hangs on the wall above the bed. This room does not seem quite as untidy as the rest of the house. You see no dust or cobwebs.

On the bed is a little pillow.

On the dresser are a brush and a cologne bottle.

>x painting
This painting looks like Picasso's rendering of "The Twillight Zone's" title shot.

>turn on floor lamp
As you turn on the lamp, you see the picture on the wall slide to your left, revealing a small niche in the wall.

Your tired eyes are having trouble focusing on the ghostly figure before you. An angry man's spirit hovers, in chains, in front of you. The ghost speaks: "This is my room. Who let you in here?! These are not the Master's things. They're mine. MINE. MINE. MINE...

>throw spider at ghost
The posessive ghost shrieks at the sight of the stunned spider. Flustered and frightened, the spirit dissolves from view, leaving you alone again.

Loud thunder echoes all around you as the storm outside intensifies.

>x niche
It really is a hole in the wall.

>search niche
In the niche is a dusty journal.

"The Master would, or could, not, so I have stolen Dracan's star. He is an evil soul. Unlike the Master, he uses his power for amusement and profit. He is not concerned with spiritual enlightenment. There is no compassion with his power. I grow weak. I am dying. I have hidden the star in Master's special box. It never opens, it has no locks. Dracan's star never discerns. In fire, it freezes. In ice, it burns."

A painting of a snake hangs above the fireplace. A painting of an eagle hangs on the west wall. A bust of a sailor stands on a pedestal by the fireplace.

This room was designed for deep thought and research. Obviously it was once inhabited by a serious man of letters. The harsh silence in the rest of the house is muted in this room of contemplation. The east wall is completely covered with a bookcase. On the north wall is a framed star chart. A large, well-polished table dominates the middle of the room. Beside the table is an antique globe. The only exit is west.

On the table are a kerosene lamp, a bronze statue and an ancient book (which is open).

You can see a tiny scroll here.

You begin to feel a sense of urgency concerning your little brother. You feel that all is not well. Somewhere on this estate he waits for you to come save him. You must get to him in time.

>take scroll
Taken.

Entrance Hall
You are inside the mansion's foyer. This is a large and luxurious room, yet it feels strangely oppressive. A hallway lies to the north. Another passage leads east.

Covering most of the floor is a room-sized carpet that displays a pentagram. In the east wall is a brick fireplace. Atop the rug is an expensive-looking wooden chair and a couch. A painting of a snake hangs above the fireplace. A painting of an eagle hangs on the west wall. A bust of a sailor stands on a pedestal by the fireplace.

>take match
Taken.

>x match
Matchmaker, matchmaker, make me a match. Preferably a Blue Tip.

>x fireplace
The fireplace is a welcome addition to the main hall entranceway. You notice nothing unusual about it.

In the fireplace is a pile of logs.

>rub match on matchbox
The blue tip on this short stick bursts into flame.

Lightning from the storm outside intensely illuminates the entrance hall. There is loud thunder quickly following as the storm approaches.

>light scroll with match
That's not something you can switch.

The match continues to burn.

>burn scroll with match
That's not something you can switch.

The match continues to burn.

>burn logs with match
That's better. The dry firewood quickly catches fire. Now it's not so chilly.

The match continues to burn.

>! Verb problems

>put wooden box in fire
Which do you mean, the pile of burning logs or the fire?

>! Object problems

>put wooden box in pile of burning logs
You see no pile here.

>put wooden box on logs
You put the wooden box on the pile of burning logs.

The match continues to burn.

>x box
The representation of a flaming stick indicates that this is a box of matches.

Loud thunder echoes all around you as the storm outside intensifies.

The match is going out.

>x wooden box
This wooden box glows with a lustrous finish and closes to an airtight seal.

The match is going out.

>x wooden box

The match you lit before has now gone out.

>! The wooden box is on the fire. Or is it? It's not burning.

>x logs
Flames emerge from the logs, feeding on the dried wood. Despite the radiant, warm glow that emanates from the fireplace, you still feel a penetrating chill very deep inside of you. It is a cold that makes you tremble despite the warmth of the fire.

This wooden box glows with a lustrous finish and closes to an airtight seal.

Hall
This room is devoid of any aesthetic warmth or beauty. It is purely functional, with no concern for the trivialities of interior design. To the south is the foyer. Two doors go southwest and west. One door goes east. A staircase leads up. A small painting hangs between the two west-facing doors. Near the staircase is a framed sepia-toned photograph with some writing on it.

Dining Room
This is an impressive sight. You could throw a terrific birthday bash in this room. The odor of stale wine still permeates the air. On the north and south walls are large paintings. Doors lead east to the hallway, north, south, and west.

You can see a dining table (on which are a champagne bottle (which is empty), a pepper mill and a pewter bowl (in which are a banana, a plum and an apple)) here.

>s

Rec Room
This looks like a room designed for fun and games. It seems out of place on this gloomy estate. To the west is a rustic-looking door. On the east and west walls are some rather ugly paintings. The dining room is to the north. The hallway is to the east.

You can see a chess table, a gramophone and a cabinet here.

>x gramophone
Until now, you had only seen a gramophone in the movies. This record player has no electronic parts. It consists of a crankshaft, a nail of a needle, and a cone-like horn for a speaker. On the platter is a 78 rpm copy (with a MacNifty label) of Rudy Valee singing "Winchester Cathedral".
The gramophone is currently switched off.

>switch on gramophone
As the old Victrola spews out its sounds, a problem occurs within, causing the record to start skipping and soon the old mainspring snaps with a loud "POP". Anyway, that Rudy Vallee sure has a shnazzy sound.

>w

Trophy Room
The walls of this room are lined with the heads of dead animals. A mounted bear stands in a corner. A tiger skin covers the middle of the floor. To the north is a door leading outside. You can go back to the rec room using the door to the east.

You can see a small cage (which is closed and empty) here.

Loud thunder echoes all around you as the storm outside intensifies.

Backyard
This large expanse of backyard reminds you of the "Wizard of Oz". A path leads north across the lawn to three buildings far in the distance.

A strange creature resembling an eye with wings passes in front of you. Did you ever get the feeling that you were being watched?

You can see a flying eye here.

Yard Path
You stand at a four-way intersection of paths. North is a greenhouse. West is an observatory. East is an old chapel.

Greenhouse Entrance
You stand before the entrance to a greenhouse. The glass is covered with what appears to be dust and condensation inside.

>n

Greenhouse
This steel and glass structure must have once housed a multitude of life-forms. Now potted corpses inhabit shallow, clay graves. It seems that living organisms don't do too well on this estate. Whoever lived here must have had a gold touch, but no green thumb.

On the table are a blue pot, a brown pot, a yellow pot, a green pot, a red pot, a white pot and a rock.

You can see a watering can (in which is some water) here.

>take can
Taken.

>x blue pot
It's a blue pot.
Nothing is growing in the parched and thirsty soil contained in the blue pot.

>put water on blue pot
You need to be holding the water before you can put it on top of something else.

At this point you begin to worry about your little brother. You were supposed to take care of him, but you have not seen him for hours. You pray that no harm has come to him.

>pour water on blue pot
You pour the water into the blue pot.

>drop can
Dropped.

Chapel Entrance
To the east is a large, jewel-studded entrance. The wind attacks your exposed flesh. Ears, fingers, and your nose are the premier casualties.

You can see two vicious dogs here.

>chant "specan heafod abraxas"
Nothing happens.

A strange creature resembling an eye with wings passes in front of you. Did you ever get the feeling that you were being watched?

>! oops

>chant "instantum illuminaris abraxas"
With the utterance of these magic words comes a blinding bolt of lightning and a blast of thunder.

At this, the dogs recoil. They put their tails between their legs and scamper across the grounds of the estate. You now have access to the chapel door. From now on you might want to watch where you step.

The flying eye flutters away.

You can't go that way.

(first opening the chapel door)

Chapel
You stand in solemn awe in this abandoned house of worship. In the silence you can hear the prayers of righteous predecessors. You feel the presence of many long-dead worshippers. You feel yourself a stranger, yet you feel protected. In the east wall, beside the altar is a beautiful and very large stained glass window. There is a heavy-looking side door in the north wall, which is closed.

On the stone altar are a cross and a white candle.

>x window
The small pieces of stained glass form colorful geometric patterns. When sunlight passes through it, it bathes the room in a rich, warm, rosy glow.

>x cross
The small wooden cross, although dry and warped, exudes a distinct aura of purity and good like nothing else on this estate. It appears to be quite old. It also has been handled considerably, as shown by the many smooth surfaces that once had detail.

>take cross
As you move the cross you see the altar move to the side, revealing a small, dark hole.

>x hole
Under the altar is a dark hole, stretching down some seventy feet. The stale, damp odor of stagnant water and decaying flesh rises up out of the hole and brutally assaults your olfactory senses.

>chant "specan heafod abraxas"
Nothing happens.

>n
(first opening the side door)
It seems to be locked.

>take candle
Taken.

>! Hmm?in the original there is a bust that opens the door with the spell.

>search chapel
You find nothing of interest.

>x altar
At the front of the chapel is a stone altar. It is adorned with gold and silver plating and ome large gems. None of the decorations on the altar seem to have any religious significance.

>! Typo: "ome large gems" not "some large gems"

>x door
Which do you mean, the side door or the chapel door?

>side
This heavy door looks as if it were intended to be the lid of a coffin.

Again, the evil that dwells within the estate vie for control of your spirit. Its influence grows more and more powerful. Soon you will not have the strength to fight it off. You can feel the spirits collected here are anxiously anticipating your induction.
