Front Yard
You stand at the front porch of a house. This old, Gothic mansion casts gloomy shadows all around you. A sharp wind cuts through your flesh to chill your bones. The pounding thunder grows louder and more threatening. A curiously-shaped knocker adorns the front door. Flanking the front door is a pair of marble statues. 

You can see a mailbox (which is closed) here.

BOOM! There is a mighty explosion behind you as your car bursts into flames. That will at least save you the cost of a tow. Better try to find your younger brother and have him call a cab instead of a tow truck.

>open mailbox
You open the mailbox, revealing an envelope.

>take envelope
Taken.

Entrance Hall
As you enter the mansion, the door slams closed behind you. Welcome home. You are inside the mansion's foyer. This is a large and luxurious room, yet it feels strangely oppressive. A hallway lies to the north. Another passage leads east.

Covering most of the floor is a room-sized carpet that displays a pentagram. In the east wall is a brick fireplace. Atop the rug is an expensive-looking wooden chair and a couch. A painting of a snake hangs above the fireplace. A painting of an eagle hangs on the west wall. A bust of a sailor stands on a pedestal by the fireplace.

On the mantelpiece is a kerosene lamp.

>take lamp
Taken.

Loud thunder echoes all around you as the storm outside intensifies.

Library
This room was designed for deep thought and research. Obviously it was once inhabited by a serious man of letters. The harsh silence in the rest of the house is muted in this room of contemplation. The east wall is completely covered with a bookcase. On the north wall is a framed star chart. A large, well-polished table dominates the middle of the room. Beside the table is an antique globe. The only exit is west.

On the table are a bronze statue and an ancient book.

>put lamp on table
As you put the kerosene lamp on the table, it emits a faint hum.

>open book
(the ancient book)
As you open the ancient book, a tiny scroll slides out.

>read scroll
Carefully written in very tiny script is: 
"Thaumaturgy 101 notes:
Casting Spells:
1) Check the meaning of the words.
2) Say the words to the target of your spell. (target, plugh)
3) Chant the words precisely when there is no target. (chant "xyzzy")

Study for the exam!!!
" 
On the back is some scrawl that reads, "What happened to my notebook? I need to to LOOK UP some chemical elements."

>statue, specan heafod abraxas
The statue trembles and utters the words "What? I didn't say anything!"

>! Nice. Don't recall this joke from the original.

Entrance Hall
You are inside the mansion's foyer. This is a large and luxurious room, yet it feels strangely oppressive. A hallway lies to the north. Another passage leads east.

Covering most of the floor is a room-sized carpet that displays a pentagram. In the east wall is a brick fireplace. Atop the rug is an expensive-looking wooden chair and a couch. A painting of a snake hangs above the fireplace. A painting of an eagle hangs on the west wall. A bust of a sailor stands on a pedestal by the fireplace.

(first opening the hall door)

Hall
This room is devoid of any aesthetic warmth or beauty. It is purely functional, with no concern for the trivialities of interior design. To the south is the foyer. Two doors go southwest and west. One door goes east. A staircase leads up. A small painting hangs between the two west-facing doors. Near the staircase is a framed sepia-toned photograph with some writing on it.

>u

Upstairs Hallway
The old wooden floorboards creak under your weight. Your creaking footsteps echo through the emptiness of the huge house. Doors lead west, northwest, east, northeast, and southeast. A stuffed fish hangs on the wall at the end of the hallway.

(first opening the closet door)

Storage Closet
This is a good-sized closet with lots of room for bric-a-brac. Several shelves line the walls. A bare light bulb hangs from the ceiling. You can leave the way you came in, to the north-west.

On the shelf are a filthy bowl, an ashtray, a bottle of No-Ghost, a detergent box, a cardboard box, a thin box, a hatbox, a can of pesticide and a can of spider cider.

A mop leans against the wall.

You can also see a broom and a tarp here.

One door goes east. A staircase leads up. A small painting hangs between the two west-facing doors. Near the staircase is a framed sepia-toned photograph with some writing on it.

You now have to question the reliability of your eyes. You think you see a somewhat cute, abstract creature with a brass key in its hand prance by. You're not sure whether it's your eyes or your mind playing tricks on you. It could be both.

Lightning from the storm outside intensely illuminates the hall. There is loud thunder quickly following as the storm approaches.

>e
(first opening the parlor door)
As you touch the doorknob, a strange woman appears. She is dressed like Scarlett O'Hara and stands with her back to you. You pause in wonder.

The gremlin skitters away, waving a brass key.

>open no-ghost
As you remove the cap from this small bottle, a foul odor bombards your olfactory senses. The liquid contents of this nearly empty bottle produce a smell similar to that of an injured skunk. It reminds you of the smell of decay that surrounds the house itself.

That was definitely not your imagination. This little creature is definitely running circles around you.

>throw no-ghost at woman
You splash the foul-smelling liquid on the head of the over-dressed guest. The liquid seems to burn as it drips over her. She lets out a horrifying scream as she begins to melt helplessly. Suddenly you feel like Dorothy (and her little dog too).

The gremlin rockets out of the room, waving a brass key.

>e

Parlor
This parlor has lost its original charm. The cracked, dirty walls are a testament to the estate's state of disrepair. A simple chandelier hangs from the ceiling. An antique chair sits in a corner. In the opposite corner is a large vase of artificial flowers. A veranda can be seen outside to the east. The hallway is to the west.

You can see a vase (in which are some artificial flowers) here.

>e

Veranda
From here you have a splendid view of the desolate estate.

A large black spider quickly runs by you along the railing.

>spray spider cider on railing
A wide aerosol stream sprays from the "Spider Cider" can. It leaves a wet, sticky film on the railing.

You see the spider continue its trek across the railing. It becomes paralyzed as it comes into contact with the "spider cider". It's not dead, but it's not going anywhere without your help.

>drop spider cider
Dropped.

>take spider
Which do you mean, the can of spider cider or the black spider?

>black
Taken.

The smiling, tiny, mischievous creature is back again. This little guy just doesn't stop.

You can also see a vase (in which are some artificial flowers) here.

The loneliness of this abandoned estate makes you long for the company of your little brother. You have seen neither hide nor hair of him in quite a while. He should be somewhere on this estate. You'd better find him.

The gremlin skitters away, waving a brass key.

Dining Room
This is an impressive sight. You could throw a terrific birthday bash in this room. The odor of stale wine still permeates the air. On the north and south walls are large paintings. Doors lead east to the hallway, north, south, and west.

You can see a dining table (on which are a bouquet of flowers, a champagne bottle (which is empty), a pepper mill and a pewter bowl (in which are a banana, a plum and an apple)) here.

>w

Kitchen
Upon entering the kitchen, you realize that this room is probably the most modern room in the house. After all, it appears to have been remodeled sometime during the 20th century. The cabinets are very well-made. Small doors head north and south. The dining room is to the east.

On the counter are a menacing knife, a little knife, a cleaver, a chef knife and a stained cookie jar.

On the pot rack are a frying pan, a nonstick pan, a shiny pan, a sauce pan and a roasting pan.

You can see some cabinets here.

>open cabinet
You open the cabinets, revealing a paintbrush.

Pantry
This pantry smells musty and stuffy. Patches of wallpaper are missing in several spots. This tiny little room does not fit in with the rest of this sprawling palatial estate. A lamp hangs from the ceiling.

On the shelf are a pewter plate, a silver tray, a matchbox, a salami, a kitchen knife, a beater, a baster, a spatula and a thermometer.

You can see a bag of flour, a bag of rice, a bag of sugar and a bag of salt here.

Servant's Bedroom
Whoever had occupied this room must have been quite satisfied with the small accomodations. There is a simple bed, a floor lamp, and a dresser. A small painting hangs on the wall above the bed. This room does not seem quite as untidy as the rest of the house. You see no dust or cobwebs.

On the bed is a little pillow.

On the dresser are a brush and a cologne bottle.

>turn on lamp
As you turn on the lamp, you see the picture on the wall slide to your left, revealing a small niche in the wall.

Your tired eyes are having trouble focusing on the ghostly figure before you. An angry man's spirit hovers, in chains, in front of you. The ghost speaks: "This is my room. Who let you in here?! These are not the Master's things. They're mine. MINE. MINE. MINE...

Loud thunder echoes all around you as the storm outside intensifies.

>throw spider at ghost
The posessive ghost shrieks at the sight of the stunned spider. Flustered and frightened, the spirit dissolves from view, leaving you alone again.

>search niche
In the niche is a dusty journal.

>read journal
"The Master would, or could, not, so I have stolen Dracan's star. He is an evil soul. Unlike the Master, he uses his power for amusement and profit. He is not concerned with spiritual enlightenment. There is no compassion with his power. I grow weak. I am dying. I have hidden the star in Master's special box. It never opens, it has no locks. Dracan's star never discerns. In fire, it freezes. In ice, it burns."

The kiddie creature runs past waving his brass key. The way he runs around he must get very hungry. This little devil must eat something that makes him awfully hyper.

You slash the upholstery of the chair with the chef knife and discover a skeleton key.

Master Bedroom
This must be the master bedroom. Interesting decor. There is a stale smell about this room, as if it hasn't been opened for years. Along the west wall are a row of photographs and a large wardrobe. Pushed up against the north wall is a large, comfortable-looking bed. Beside it is a floor-standing lamp. The hallway lies east. Another doorway faces south.

You can see a wheelchair and a table (on which are a black diary, a grey candle, a blue bottle (which is empty) and a brown bottle) here.

>unlock wardrobe with key
You unlock the wardrobe.

>open wardrobe
You open the wardrobe, revealing a small papyrus scroll, a large papyrus scroll, a wooden box and a golden vial.

>open matchbox
You open the matchbox, revealing six matches.

The evil air that pervades the estate seems to have infiltrated your very being. Your head and chest feel heavy and thick. You find it increasingly difficult to execute your will. For a minute, your thoughts seemed influenced by another mind.

The quick creature seems to be playing a 'catch-me-if-you-can' game. He's winning. He waves his brass key wildly, teasing you with it as he runs through the room.

Loud thunder echoes all around you as the storm outside intensifies.

>take match
Taken.

>rub match on matchbox
The blue tip on this short stick bursts into flame.

The gremlin zooms away, waving a brass key.

>put match on wood
That's better. The dry firewood quickly catches fire. Now it's not so chilly.

As you toss the box into the fire, a large thick, puff of smoke jumps out. As the smoke clears you notice a brass pentagram that apparently survived the burning of the box has jumped out as well.

(first opening the recroom door)

Rec Room
This looks like a room designed for fun and games. It seems out of place on this gloomy estate. To the west is a rustic-looking door. On the east and west walls are some rather ugly paintings. The dining room is to the north. The hallway is to the east.

You can see a chess table, a gramophone and a cabinet here.

>turn on gramophone
As the old Victrola spews out its sounds, a problem occurs within, causing the record to start skipping and soon the old mainspring snaps with a loud "POP". Anyway, that Rudy Vallee sure has a shnazzy sound.

>w

Trophy Room
The walls of this room are lined with the heads of dead animals. A mounted bear stands in a corner. A tiger skin covers the middle of the floor. To the north is a door leading outside. You can go back to the rec room using the door to the east.

You can see a small cage (which is closed and empty) here.

Backyard
This large expanse of backyard reminds you of the "Wizard of Oz". A path leads north across the lawn to three buildings far in the distance.

Yard Path
You stand at a four-way intersection of paths. North is a greenhouse. West is an observatory. East is an old chapel.

Greenhouse Entrance
You stand before the entrance to a greenhouse. The glass is covered with what appears to be dust and condensation inside.

A strange creature resembling an eyeball with wings passes in front of you. Did you ever get the feeling that you were being watched?

>n

Greenhouse
This steel and glass structure must have once housed a multitude of life-forms. Now potted corpses inhabit shallow, clay graves. It seems that living organisms don't do too well on this estate. Whoever lived here must have had a gold touch, but no green thumb.

On the table are a blue pot, a brown pot, a yellow pot, a green pot, a red pot and a white pot.

You can see a watering can (in which is some water) here.

>x blue pot
It's a blue pot.
In the blue pot, dead wood sticks poke out of rock-hard dirt.

A strange creature resembling an eyeball with wings passes in front of you. Did you ever get the feeling that you were being watched?

It's a brown pot.
The dead plant in the brown pot has begun to decay. It is covered by a fine white film.

Bedroom
This room has a strange energy about it. There is a powerful presence in here. You do not feel alone, just insignificant.

Against the north wall is a bed and bedside table. Above the bed is a small reading lamp. Opposite the bed, on the south wall, is a large, abstract painting. On the west wall is a large wardrobe. The hallway is to the east. A small door is in the north wall.

On the bedside table are a red candle and a star diary.

You can also see a bed (on which are a white pillow and a black pillow) here.

>read diary
Several pages are torn out. The only remaining page with writing on it reads:

"My star is gone, but not lost. Master's servant will pay for his betrayal. The vehicle of my power has not yet served its purpose. When it sets me free, I will have a chance to realize my unlimited potential. The forces of the technological society will be unprepared for the likes of me. I will not be denied. My omnipotence is inevitable."

Bathroom
This bathroom is cold and dark. You can see a white sink and a porcelain bathtub here. There is no toilet. Whoever lived here really did have a mysterious way of doing things. The door is to the south. Your attention is drawn to a strangly-shaped light fixture on the ceiling.

You can see a drain, two towels, a laundry hamper and a marble shelf (on which is a bar of soap) here.

>turn on faucet
Which do you mean, the gold faucet or the white faucet?

You turn on the white faucet and water comes out.

Lightning from the storm outside intensely illuminates the bathroom. There is loud thunder quickly following as the storm approaches.

Study
You're in a small study. A small desk squats in the middle of the room. To the east is a door. To the south is the dining room.

Brrrr. There is no central heating in this old Gothic mansion. The curved outer wall of this room is exposed to the elements in three directions. It is colder in here than it is outside, and there is no fireplace. It must be awful during the winter.

On the desk is a blotter.

>open desk
You open the drawer in the desk revealing a notebook.

Lightning from the storm outside intensely illuminates the study. There is loud thunder quickly following as the storm approaches.

>read notebook
Flipping through the notebook, you see that each page contains a brief handwritten description of each of the chemical elements. It seems to end with "einsteinium". You close the notebook.

(If you want to read about a specific element, just do something like "READ ABOUT CARBON IN THE NOTEBOOK".)

>read about chlorine in notebook
#17. Chlorine. Cl. A greenish, poisonous, and corrosive gas. Many of its compounds are used as cleaners and disinfectants. When combined with sodium, the result is table salt.

Loud thunder echoes all around you as the storm outside intensifies.

>read about lithium in notebook
#3. Lithium. Li. A very light and reactive metal, lithium is important in nuclear chemistry and medicine.

>read about bromine in notebook
#35. Bromine. Br. A foul-smelling, highly-reactive liquid, bromine is the third of the halogens. Its properties are very similar to those of chlorine and fluorine above.

>read blotter
Remembering a certain detective novel, you look at the blotter at an angle to better read what might have been written on papers resting upon it. You are ultimately unable to read anything and you don't have a pencil to make it easier.

Dining Room
This is an impressive sight. You could throw a terrific birthday bash in this room. The odor of stale wine still permeates the air. On the north and south walls are large paintings. Doors lead east to the hallway, north, south, and west.

You can see a dining table (on which are a champagne bottle (which is empty), a pepper mill and a pewter bowl (in which are a banana, a plum and an apple)) here.

The kiddie creature runs past waving his brass key. The way he runs around he must get very hungry. This little devil must eat something that makes him awfully hyper.

Loud thunder echoes all around you as the storm outside intensifies.

Hall
This room is devoid of any aesthetic warmth or beauty. It is purely functional, with no concern for the trivialities of interior design. To the south is the foyer. Two doors go southwest and west. One door goes east. A staircase leads up. A small painting hangs between the two west-facing doors. Near the staircase is a framed sepia-toned photograph with some writing on it.

The quick creature seems to be playing a 'catch-me-if-you-can' game. He's winning. He waves his brass key wildly, teasing you with it as he runs through the room.

>s

Entrance Hall
You are inside the mansion's foyer. This is a large and luxurious room, yet it feels strangely oppressive. A hallway lies to the north. Another passage leads east.

Covering most of the floor is a room-sized carpet that displays a pentagram. In the east wall is a brick fireplace. Atop the rug is an expensive-looking wooden chair and a couch. A painting of a snake hangs above the fireplace. A painting of an eagle hangs on the west wall. A roaring fire is burning in the fireplace. A bust of a sailor stands on a pedestal by the fireplace.

You can see a chef knife here.

Library
This room was designed for deep thought and research. Obviously it was once inhabited by a serious man of letters. The harsh silence in the rest of the house is muted in this room of contemplation. The east wall is completely covered with a bookcase. On the north wall is a framed star chart. A large, well-polished table dominates the middle of the room. Beside the table is an antique globe. The only exit is west.

On the table are a tiny scroll, a kerosene lamp, a bronze statue and an ancient book (which is open).

At this point you begin to worry about your little brother. You were supposed to take care of him, but you have not seen him for hours. You pray that no harm has come to him.

>read book
(the ancient book (which is open))
The book is opened to a page which seems to be filled with definitions. The ones that make the most sense to you are: 
"Instantum: Sudden and momentary; here and gone in an instant. 
Illuminaris: A bright, white light. 
Projectum: The propulsion of an entity. 
Spearca: A small flame or spark. 
Specan: To talk, talking. 
Heafod: The head, the skull, etc. 
Magisterium: Mystery. 
Abraxas: It is a magical word: a vehicle through which magic is directed."

>put bird in small cage
You need to be holding the bird before you can put him into something else.

>catch bird with small cage
Before the dazed bird can spread its wings, you grab and quickly trap it in the portable cage. The bird is unharmed, but the uncaged animals then furiously attack each other. The cat snarls but the snake counters with a quick, venomous strike. The poison goes from the snake's fangs to the cat's bloodstream and easily disables and kills the formerly ferocious feline. The snake then swallows the cat with surprising speed.

The passage ends here. The only exit is north.

Before your eyes is the biggest, strangest creature you've ever seen. It bounces up and  down as if trying to tell you something. However you can't figure out what it's trying to say. You don't even know if it is friendly.

You can also see the Blothney Gem here.

Church Grounds
You are standing on a path that leads up to a large stone structure. Beyond the structure you see a forest that looks as if it has been ravaged by decay.

As you leave the maze, a strange ghost flies over you. It does not attack you. The glow of the candle dims the presence of the ghost. It is offended by the flame and flies off to its supernatural home.

>s

Chapel
You stand in solemn awe in this abandoned house of worship. In the silence you can hear the prayers of righteous predecessors. You feel the presence of many long-dead worshippers. You feel yourself a stranger, yet you feel protected. Beside the altar is a statue upon a pedestal. In the east wall, beside the altar is a beautiful and very large stained glass window. There is a heavy-looking side door in the north wall, which is open. Through the open door, you can see a churchyard.

The altar has moved sideways, to reveal a small hole.

You can see a burnt match here.

To the east is a large, jewel-studded entrance. The wind attacks your exposed flesh. Ears, fingers, and your nose are the premier casualties.

Observatory Entrance
You stand at the entrance of a large domed building to the west. The ugly, elaborate doorway is endowed with a strange, eclectic mix of decorations from at least three different centuries. Two brass orbs atop spires are to the left and right of the door. Just above the door, in the doorframe is an oddly-shaped niche. On the wall above the doorway is a sign reading "Magisterium".

>put gem in niche
The gem fits perfectly. It flashes and emits a strange shimmering noise. A click is heard from the door below.

Observatory Corridor
You're in a short corridor in the observatory. The door leading outside is to the east. To the west is a door with a star on it. To the north is a door with what appears to be a relief of the planet Saturn. The door to the south has nothing on it. There is a curious-looking light fixture on the ceiling.

A strange, hideous creature stares at you.

>give fruit to creature
The ugly creature's hungry eyes light up. It pounces on the fruit and swallows it whole in one gulp. While licking its lips with its long tongue, it fades and disappears. The cold, silent corridor now echoes its emptiness

>w

Laboratory
This looks like Doctor Frankenstein's laboratory. You wonder what experiments were performed in here, and by whom. You do not feel very comfortable in here. Embedded in one wall is a small iron safe. In another wall is a small fireplace. The only exit is to the east.

You can see a table (on which is an array of lab equipment) here.

>x safe
This heavy iron door is equipped with a large combination lock dial. It forms an airtight seal with the casing of the wall.

Observatory
This room is dominated by a huge telescope and the extensive gears and machinery required to operate it. You do not see an owner's manual. A star chart is fastened to one wall. Below it is a table. The only exit is south.

On the table is a mysterious book.

This large expanse of backyard reminds you of the "Wizard of Oz". A path leads north across the lawn to three buildings far in the distance.

You begin to feel a sense of urgency concerning your little brother. You feel that all is not well. Somewhere on this estate he waits for you to come save him. You must get to him in time.

Trophy Room
The walls of this room are lined with the heads of dead animals. A mounted bear stands in a corner. A tiger skin covers the middle of the floor. To the north is a door leading outside. You can go back to the rec room using the door to the east.

Rec Room
This looks like a room designed for fun and games. It seems out of place on this gloomy estate. To the west is a rustic-looking door. On the east and west walls are some rather ugly paintings. The dining room is to the north. The hallway is to the east.

You can see a chess table, a gramophone and a cabinet here.

Hall
This room is devoid of any aesthetic warmth or beauty. It is purely functional, with no concern for the trivialities of interior design. To the south is the foyer. Two doors go southwest and west. One door goes east. A staircase leads up. A small painting hangs between the two west-facing doors. Near the staircase is a framed sepia-toned photograph with some writing on it.

Upstairs Hallway
The old wooden floorboards creak under your weight. Your creaking footsteps echo through the emptiness of the huge house. Doors lead west, northwest, east, northeast, and southeast. A stuffed fish hangs on the wall at the end of the hallway.

The kiddie creature runs past waving his brass key. The way he runs around he must get very hungry. This little devil must eat something that makes him awfully hyper.

Loud thunder echoes all around you as the storm outside intensifies.

Master Bedroom
This must be the master bedroom. Interesting decor. There is a stale smell about this room, as if it hasn't been opened for years. Along the west wall are a row of photographs and a large wardrobe. Pushed up against the north wall is a large, comfortable-looking bed. Beside it is a floor-standing lamp. The hallway lies east. Another doorway faces south.

You can see a wheelchair and a table (on which are a black diary, a grey candle, a blue bottle (which is empty) and a brown bottle) here.

>read diary
This diary is filled with ramblings that you can barely understand. The only meaningful page is the last one:

"I have lost control of Dracan. My star student now fancies himself a master. Though his power is strong, his spirit is weak. He is easily corrupted by the dark spirits of greed and power. My servant, more aware than I, sealed his star in my hingeless box. They're locked away beyond his stare. I've hidden the key, a chair knows where."

An acrid mist rises from the frozen sludge of the ice-encrusted cave. The misty tendrils form themselves into a robed human figure. He has an almost benevolent appearance. He speaks directly to you.

Steam bursts from the block as it rapidly melts. The melting ice creates a flow of water that rushes into the next cave. The current sweeps a human figure from within the ice into the next cave. The robed man reappears and speaks directly to you.
