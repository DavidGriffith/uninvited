Front Yard
You stand at the front porch of a house. This old, Gothic mansion casts gloomy shadows all around you. A sharp wind cuts through your flesh to chill your bones. The pounding thunder grows louder and more threatening. A curiously-shaped knocker adorns the front door. Flanking the front door is a pair of marble statues. 

You can see a mailbox (which is closed) here.

BOOM! There is a mighty explosion behind you as your car bursts into flames. That will at least save you the cost of a tow. Better try to find your younger brother and have him call a cab instead of a tow truck.

>open mailbox
You open the mailbox, revealing an envelope.

>take envelope
Taken.

>open envelope
You open the envelope, revealing a letter and a pendant.

From the sound of distant barking, you figure it must be a very large dog.

>wear pendant
(first taking the pendant)
You put the pendant around your neck.

From the sound of distant barking, you figure it must be a very large dog.

>read letter
This note reads: 
"Dear Master. Please forgive me. My health prevents me from aiding you in your battle against the evil one. You teach your students well; they become too powerful for their own good. Enclosed is an amulet that should look familiar. Wear this charm and think of me. The undead fear symbology. Still the Evil, my friend; set it free for the sake of the family."

>i
You are carrying:
  a pendant (being worn)
  an envelope (which is open)
    a letter

>put envelope in mailbox
You put the envelope into the mailbox.

>i
You are carrying:
  a pendant (being worn)

>n
You can't, since the front door is in the way.

>open front door
The door creaks open.

Entrance Hall
As you enter the mansion, the door slams closed behind you. Welcome home. You are inside the mansion's foyer. This is a large and luxurious room, yet it feels strangely oppressive. A hallway lies to the north. Another passage leads east.

Covering most of the floor is a room-sized carpet that displays a pentagram. In the east wall is a brick fireplace. Atop the rug is an expensive-looking wooden chair and a couch. A painting of a snake hangs above the fireplace. A painting of an eagle hangs on the west wall. A bust of a sailor stands on a pedestal by the fireplace.

On the mantelpiece is a kerosene lamp.

>take lamp
Taken.

>x lamp
It is an old Victorian kerosene lamp.

>x snake painting
This painting depicts a mighty python wrapping itself around a rather large egg. The egg seems unphased as stares intently across the room.

>x eagle painting
A great bird of prey is pictured swooping down, talons extended, upon some undepicted victim. The painting is a striking work in oils on canvas.

>x fireplace
The fireplace is a welcome addition to the main hall entranceway. You notice nothing unusual about it.

In the fireplace.

>* Fireplace description should mention wood ready to burn, since later the PC starts a fire.
[Comment recorded.]

>x x couch
You see no x couch here.

>x couch
The couch looks comfortable. It is just long enough for you to lie down and stretch out upon.

>x carpet
The pentagram is set against a circular star field.

>x star field
You see no star field here.

>* Should repeat container's description if you don't want to describe child entities you mention.

(first opening the hall door)

Hall
This room is devoid of any aesthetic warmth or beauty. It is purely functional, with no concern for the trivialities of interior design. To the south is the foyer. Two doors go southwest and west. One door goes east. A staircase leads up. A small painting hangs between the two west-facing doors.

>x painting
It looks like a still reproduced from F. W Murnau's film, "Nosferatu". There seems to be a familiar face in the background. On closer examination it appears to be Dave Feldman, whose wit and insight was a valuable asset in the creation of "Uninvited".

>* Put a second painting in the hall with your own face here (maybe mine as well!).
[Comment recorded.]

>up

Upstairs Hallway
The old wooden floorboards creak under your weight. Your creaking footsteps echo through the emptiness of the huge house. Doors lead west, northwest, east, northeast, and southeast. A stuffed fish hangs on the wall at the end of the hallway.

>x fish
There's something fishy about this trophy.

>search in fish
You can't see any such thing.

>search fish
You find nothing of interest.

>* Always seemed to me that something should happen with this fish.
[Comment recorded.]

>se
(first opening the closet door)

Storage Closet
This is a good-sized closet with lots of room for bric-a-brac. Several shelves line the walls. A bare light bulb hangs from the ceiling. You can leave the way you came in, to the north-west.

You now have to question the reliability of your eyes. You think you see a somewhat cute, abstract creature with a brass key in its hand prance by. You're not sure whether it's your eyes or your mind playing tricks on you. It could be both.

On the shelf are a filthy bowl, an ashtray, a bottle of No-Ghost, a detergent box, a cardboard box, a thin box, a hatbox, a can of pesticide and a can of spider cider.

A mop leans against the wall.

You can also see a broom and a tarp here.

The gremlin prances away, waving a brass key.

>take no-ghost, spider cider 
bottle of No-Ghost: Taken.
can of spider cider: Taken.

>open bottle
As you remove the cap from this small bottle, a foul odor bombards your olfactory senses. The liquid contents of this nearly empty bottle produce a smell similar to that of an injured skunk. It reminds you of the smell of decay that surrounds the house itself.

>nw

Upstairs Hallway
The old wooden floorboards creak under your weight. Your creaking footsteps echo through the emptiness of the huge house. Doors lead west, northwest, east, northeast, and southeast. A stuffed fish hangs on the wall at the end of the hallway.

Lightning from the storm outside intensely illuminates the upstairs hallway. There is loud thunder quickly following as the storm approaches.

>sw
(first opening the recroom door)
As you touch the doorknob, a strange woman appears. She is dressed like Scarlett O'Hara and stands with her back to you. You pause in wonder.

>throw no-ghost on woman
You splash the foul-smelling liquid on the head of the over-dressed guest. The liquid seems to burn as it drips over her. She lets out a horrifying scream as she begins to melt helplessly. Suddenly you feel like Dorothy (and her little dog too).

>drop no-ghost
You see no no-ghost here.

>i
You are carrying:
  a can of spider cider
  a kerosene lamp

Rec Room
This looks like a room designed for fun and games. It seems out of place on this gloomy estate. To the west is a rustic-looking door. On the east and west walls are some rather ugly paintings. The dining room is to the north. The hallway is to the east.

You can see a chess table, a gramophone and a cabinet here.

>x chess table
Inlaid on the face of this table is a chess board. You wonder if there are any chess pieces lying around.

>x gramophone
Until now, you had only seen a gramophone in the movies. This record player has no electronic parts. It consists of a crankshaft, a nail of a needle, and a cone-like horn for a speaker. On the platter is a 78 rpm copy (with a MacNifty label) of Rudy Valee singing "Winchester Cathedral".
The gramophone is currently switched off.

>turn gramophone on
As the old Victrola spews out its sounds, a problem occurs within, causing the record to start skipping and soon the old mainspring snaps with a loud "POP". Anyway, that Rudy Vallee sure has a shnazzy sound.

>* Thought that you'd changed this to include more details; no big deal.
[Comment recorded.]

>x paintings
The paintings are very ugly. That's really all there is to say about them.

The loneliness of this abandoned estate makes you long for the company of your little brother. You have seen neither hide nor hair of him in quite a while. He should be somewhere on this estate. You'd better find him.

>w

Trophy Room
The walls of this room are lined with the heads of dead animals. A mounted bear stands in a corner. A tiger skin covers the middle of the floor. To the north is a door leading outside. You can go back to the rec room using the door to the east.

You can see a small cage (which is closed and empty) here.

>n
(first opening the back door)

Backyard
This large expanse of backyard reminds you of the "Wizard of Oz". A path leads north across the lawn to three buildings far in the distance.

A strange creature resembling an eye with wings passes in front of you. Did you ever get the feeling that you were being watched?

You can see a flying eye here.

The flying eye flutters away.

>n

Yard Path
You stand at a four-way intersection of paths. North is a greenhouse. West is an observatory. East is an old chapel.

Greenhouse Entrance
You stand before the entrance to a greenhouse. The glass is covered with what appears to be dust and condensation inside.

>n

Greenhouse
This steel and glass structure must have once housed a multitude of life-forms. Now potted corpses inhabit shallow, clay graves. It seems that living organisms don't do too well on this estate. Whoever lived here must have had a gold touch, but no green thumb.

On the table are a blue pot, a brown pot, a yellow pot, a green pot, a red pot, a white pot and a rock.

You can see a watering can (in which is some water) here.

>x blue pot
It's a blue pot.
The plant in the blue pot is seriously dead.

A strange creature resembling an eye with wings passes in front of you. Did you ever get the feeling that you were being watched?

>x brown pot
It's a brown pot.
Nothing is growing in the parched and thirsty soil contained in the brown pot.

The flying eye flutters away.

>x yellow pot
It's a yellow pot.
In the yellow pot, dead wood sticks poke out of rock-hard dirt.

A strange creature resembling an eye with wings passes in front of you. Did you ever get the feeling that you were being watched?

>x green pot
It's a green pot.
The dead plant in the green pot has begun to decay. It is covered by a fine white film.

The flying eye flutters away.

>x red pot
It's a red pot.
In the red pot this dead plant used to be a fern, perhaps.

>x white pot
It's a white pot.
The white pot contains a plant skeleton.

>x rock
You see nothing special about the rock.

>x watering can
This tin watering can has a long spout for reaching into plants and depositing water at their dirt floors.

>look in watering can
In the watering can is some water.

A strange creature resembling an eye with wings passes in front of you. Did you ever get the feeling that you were being watched?

>pour water on brown pot
You pour the water into the brown pot.

>open cabinet
It seems to be locked.

The evil air that pervades the estate seems to have infiltrated your very being. Your head and chest feel heavy and thick. You find it increasingly difficult to execute your will. For a minute, your thoughts seemed influenced by another mind.

>unlock cabinet
What do you want nothing to unlock the cabinet with?

>ne

That isn't available.

Dining Room
This is an impressive sight. You could throw a terrific birthday bash in this room. The odor of stale wine still permeates the air. On the north and south walls are large paintings. Doors lead east to the hallway, north, south, and west.

You can see a dining table (on which are a bouquet of flowers, a champagne bottle (which is empty), a pepper mill and a pewter bowl (in which are a banana, a plum and an apple)) here.

>t bouquet
That's not a verb I recognize.

>take bouquet
Taken.

>* I guess it's iPhone Frotz that abbreviates "take" to "t"
[Comment recorded.]

Kitchen
Upon entering the kitchen, you realize that this room is probably the most modern room in the house. After all, it appears to have been remodeled sometime during the 20th century. Small doors head north and south. The dining room is to the east.

On the counter are a menacing knife, a little knife, a cleaver, a chef knife and a stained cookie jar.

On the pot rack are a frying pan, a nonstick pan, a shiny pan, a sauce pan and a roasting pan.

>take manacing knife
You see no manacing knife here.

>take menacing knife
Taken.

>x frying pan
This frying pan has a nice, heat-dispersing handle.

>x nonstick pan
This pan is coated with one of those no-stick surfaces.

>x shiny pan
This pan doesn't look like it was ever used.

>x sauce pan
This is a three-quart sauce pan

>x roasting pan
This pan looks like it could hold a nice-sized roast. You feel like you could eat one.

>x little knife
This is a very sharp little blade. It has a sturdy little plastic handle. It must be a famous Ginsu.

>x menacing knife
This knife catches the light and glints menacingly. It looks sharp and dangerous.

>x cleaver
It's a meat cleaver, just like the butchers on T.V. commercials use. This one has some dried blood on it.

>x chef knife
This is your basic, large, wooden-handled kitchen knife. The blade has been dulled by time and use.

>x jar
This large cookie jar is stained by tiny droplets of blood around its upper edge. It looks like an item from the Bates Motel rummage sale.

>open jar
You open the stained cookie jar.

>look in jar
The stained cookie jar is empty.

Lightning from the storm outside intensely illuminates the kitchen. There is loud thunder quickly following as the storm approaches.

>i

Bedroom
Whoever had occupied this room must have been quite satisfied with the small accomodations. There is a simple bed, a floor lamp, and a dresser. This room does not seem quite as untidy as the rest of the house. You see no dust or cobwebs.

On the bed is a little pillow.

On the dresser are a brush and a cologne bottle.

>x lamp
(the kerosene lamp)
It is an old Victorian kerosene lamp.

>x floor lamp
I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the ground.

>* Should probably disambiguate between carried lamp and this floor lamp.
[Comment recorded.]

>x brush
The bristles of this dirty, dusty brush are filled with strands of grey hair and white specks.

>x bottle
This bottle of cologne is labeled "Horsetrader".

You begin to feel a sense of urgency concerning your little brother. You feel that all is not well. Somewhere on this estate he waits for you to come save him. You must get to him in time.

>n

Pantry
This pantry smells musty and stuffy. Patches of wallpaper are missing in several spots. This tiny little room does not fit in with the rest of this sprawling palatial estate. A lamp hangs from the ceiling.

On the shelf are a pewter plate, a silver tray, a matchbox, a salami, a kitchen knife, a beater, a baster, a spatula and a thermometer.

You can see a bag of flour, a bag of rice, a bag of sugar and a bag of salt here.

Study
You're in a small study. A small desk squats in the middle of the room. To the east is a door. To the south is the dining room.

Brrrr. There is no central heating in this old Gothic mansion. The curved outer wall of this room is exposed to the elements in three directions. It is colder in here than it is outside, and there is no fireplace. It must be awful during the winter.

On the desk is a blotter.

>x blotter
This ink blotter is marked with the lines of many letters. Fine indentations criss-cross the surface of the blotter.

>read blotter
The blotter doesn't seem to bear any writing.

>open desk
You open the drawer in the desk revealing a notebook.

>read notebook
Flipping through the notebook, you see that each page contains a brief handwritten description of each of the chemical elements. It seems to end with "einsteinium". You close the notebook.

(first opening the parlor door)

Parlor
This parlor has lost its original charm. The cracked, dirty walls are a testament to the estate's state of disrepair. A simple chandelier hangs from the ceiling. An antique chair sits in a corner. In the opposite corner is a large vase of artificial flowers. A veranda can be seen outside to the east. The hallway is to the west.

You can see a vase (in which are some artificial flowers) here.

>x vase
It looks like a goldfish bowl, but it's serving as a vase. Function before form, perhaps -- just as in your case.

>e

Veranda
From here you have a splendid view of the desolate estate.

A large black spider quickly runs by you along the railing.

>spray spider cider on railing
A wide aerosol stream sprays from the "Spider Cider" can. It leaves a wet, sticky film on the railing.

You see the spider continue its trek across the railing. It becomes paralyzed as it comes into contact with the "spider cider". It's not dead, but it's not going anywhere without your help.

Master Bedroom
This must be the master bedroom. Interesting decor. There is a stale smell about this room, as if it hasn't been opened for years. Along the west wall are a row of photographs and a large wardrobe. Pushed up against the north wall is a large, comfortable-looking bed. Beside it is a floor-standing lamp. The hallway lies east. Another doorway faces south.

You can see a wheelchair and a table (on which are a black diary, a grey candle, a blue bottle (which is empty) and a brown bottle) here.

>read diary
This diary is filled with ramblings that you can barely understand. The only meaningful page is the last one:

"I have lost control of Dracan. My star student now fancies himself a master. Though his power is strong, his spirit is weak. He is easily corrupted by the dark spirits of greed and power. My servant, more aware than I, sealed his star in my hingeless box. They're locked away beyond his stare. I've hidden the key, a chair knows where."

>open wardrobe
It seems to be locked.

>s

Master Bathroom
Whoever decorated this bathroom certainly had ecelctic tastes. There is a large granite bathtub at one end of the room and a marble sink at the other. The decor could be described as "African Art Deco". The only exit is north.

You can see a shelf (on which are a yellow bottle, an amber bottle and a red bottle), an African mask, a clay mask, a Mayan mask, a Voodoo doll and two fluffy towels here.

>x african mask
This is an ancient African ceremonial mask. Its ugly face was not meant to frighten humans. It was meant to scare off ill-willed spirits.

>x clay mask
The face of this clay mask has extremely large ears.

>x mayan mask
This Mayan mask has a cold, hard stare.

>x doll
This little Indian man look like some kind of voodoo doll. Wood, cloth, and small bits of silver leaf combine to create this anthropomorphic miniature.

>x towels
You see no towels here.

The old wooden floorboards creak under your weight. Your creaking footsteps echo through the emptiness of the huge house. Doors lead west, northwest, east, northeast, and southeast. A stuffed fish hangs on the wall at the end of the hallway.

Hall
This room is devoid of any aesthetic warmth or beauty. It is purely functional, with no concern for the trivialities of interior design. To the south is the foyer. Two doors go southwest and west. One door goes east. A staircase leads up. A small painting hangs between the two west-facing doors.

Loud thunder echoes all around you as the storm outside intensifies.

Entrance Hall
You are inside the mansion's foyer. This is a large and luxurious room, yet it feels strangely oppressive. A hallway lies to the north. Another passage leads east.

Covering most of the floor is a room-sized carpet that displays a pentagram. In the east wall is a brick fireplace. Atop the rug is an expensive-looking wooden chair and a couch. A painting of a snake hangs above the fireplace. A painting of an eagle hangs on the west wall. A bust of a sailor stands on a pedestal by the fireplace.

You slash the upholstery of the chair with the menacing knife.

Master Bedroom
This must be the master bedroom. Interesting decor. There is a stale smell about this room, as if it hasn't been opened for years. Along the west wall are a row of photographs and a large wardrobe. Pushed up against the north wall is a large, comfortable-looking bed. Beside it is a floor-standing lamp. The hallway lies east. Another doorway faces south.

You can see a wheelchair and a table (on which are a grey candle, a blue bottle (which is empty) and a brown bottle) here.

>unlock wardrobe
What do you want nothing to unlock the wardrobe with?

>key

>open wardrobe
You open the wardrobe, revealing a small papyrus scroll, a large papyrus scroll, a wooden box and a golden vial.

>read small scroll
"Together these form a key: lithium, gold, and cerium".

>read large scroll
"The heart of the garden maze contains the Blothney Gem. There are certain places you cannot go, 'till you unlock the 'mystery'".

Loud thunder echoes all around you as the storm outside intensifies.

>take box
Taken.

Lightning from the storm outside intensely illuminates the master bedroom. There is loud thunder quickly following as the storm approaches.

>x box
Which do you mean, the wooden box or the matchbox?

>wooden
This wooden box glows with a lustrous finish and closes to an airtight seal.

>x vial
This fine cut glass vial has a brilliant gold cap. Inside there is a strange liquid. It rolls around in the vial without splashing. It seems as if it were in one piece.

Again, the evil that dwells within the estate vie for control of your spirit. Its influence grows more and more powerful. Soon you will not have the strength to fight it off. You can feel the spirits collected here are anxiously anticipating your induction.

Bedroom
This room has a strange energy about it. There is a powerful presence in here. You do not feel alone, just insignificant.

Against the north wall is a bed and bedside table. Above the bed is a small reading lamp. Opposite the bed, on the south wall, is a large, abstract painting. On the west wall is a large wardrobe. The hallway is to the east. A small door is in the north wall.

On the bedside table are a red candle and a star diary.

You can also see a bed (on which are a white pillow and a black pillow) here.

Bathroom
This bathroom is cold and dark. You can see a white sink and a porcelain bathtub here. There is no toilet. Whoever lived here really did have a mysterious way of doing things. The door is to the south. Your attention is drawn to a strangly-shaped light fixture on the ceiling.

You can see a soft towel, a drain, a laundry hamper and a marble shelf (on which is a bar of soap) here.

>open hamper
You open the laundry hamper, revealing a bloody towel.

>stand on hamper
That's not something you can stand on.

This large light fixture vaguely resembles something from a playground that children like to hang and swing from.

Bedroom
This room is like your typical, twentieth century bourgois bedroom -- a place to relax, perhaps? Against the far wall is a large bed. Next to it is a dresser. Hanging over the bed is a small mirror. A large, old radio stands against another wall. The only exit is to the south-west.

>open dresser
You open the top drawer in the dresser revealing an iron star.

Library
This room was designed for deep thought and research. Obviously it was once inhabited by a serious man of letters. The harsh silence in the rest of the house is muted in this room of contemplation. The east wall is completely covered with a bookcase. On the north wall is a framed star chart. A large, well-polished table dominates the middle of the room. Beside the table is an antique globe. The only exit is west.

On the table are a bronze statue and an ancient book.

>open book
(the ancient book)
As you open the ancient book, a tiny scroll slides out.

>read scroll
Carefully written in very tiny script is: 
"Thaumaturgy 101 notes:
Casting Spells:
1) Check the meaning of the words.
2) Say the words to the target of your spell. (target, plugh)
3) Chant the words precisely when there is no target. (chant "xyzzy")

Study for the exam!!!"

>read book
(the ancient book (which is open))
The book is opened to a page which seems to be filled with definitions. The ones that make the most sense to you are: 
"Instantum: Sudden and momentary; here and gone in an instant. 
Illuminaris: A bright, white light. 
Projectum: The propulsion of an entity. 
Spearca: A small flame or spark. 
Specan: To talk, talking. 
Heafod: The head, the skull, etc. 
Magisterium: Mystery. 
Abraxas: It is a magical word: a vehicle through which magic is directed."

>chant "specan heafod abraxas"
Nothing happens.

>chant "instantum illuminaris abraxas"
With the utterance of these magic words comes a blinding bolt of lightning and a blast of thunder.

>chant "spearca projectum abraxas"
That's just gibberish.

>chant "xyzzy"
A hollow voice says, "Fool!".

>chant "plugh"
A hollow voice says, "Fool!".

>x bookcase
It's a bookcase filled with many fine books. You see the works of Bacon, Poe, Lovecraft, and Nostradamus. Many of the books seem to be hundreds of years old. Many are in ancient languages and are indecipherable to you.

>x chart
It's a map of the heavens -- a place you've always wanted to visit.

>put lamp on table
As you put the kerosene lamp on the table, it emits a faint hum.

>x chart
It's a map of the heavens -- a place you've always wanted to visit. You notice a very odd looking star on this chart that you didn't notice before.

Many of the voices in your mind are not your own. You begin to feel almost at home here among the undead. To your dismay the other world is beginning to look more attractive to you than this one. Its inhabitants beckon to you, but you are not yet ready to join them. You do not know where you found this final reserve of willpower. It came not a moment too soon; it is almost too late.

>x star
(the iron star)
The symbol of the pentagram seems to be the major motif in the ornamentation of this mansion. This five-pointed iron star fits in the palm of your hand.

>touch star
(the iron star)
You feel nothing unexpected.

>touch star chart
You feel nothing unexpected.

>x star
Which do you mean, the odd star or the star chart?

>odd star
It's a very odd star indeed. It's not at all an ordinary mark on paper. It's almost like it's not even there. There's no label or anything to tell you what it is.

>odd star, "specan heafod abraxas"
The star, doesn't say anything, but you now realize you're looking at a black hole.

Lightning from the storm outside intensely illuminates the library. There is loud thunder quickly following as the storm approaches.

>x black hole
It look a lot of very powerful magic to retain an actual reduced version of a real black hole here on this star map in this old mansion -- probably an even greater amount to transport it here.

>enter black hole
Suddenly you experience a feeling quite unlike anything you've ever experienced before. Time and space as you know it are now foreign concepts. You feel what you think is a tremendous acceleration toward the black hole, but you don't know for sure what is happening to you. You're not sure if this experience will ever end. Then suddenly...

The Art Gallery

In the Art Gallery you can see a Greek urn, a Greek bowl, a Greek plate, a painting of a siren, a painting of an emperor and an onyx key.

>x urn
This actual 3000 year old Greek urn shows paintings and designs of different activities. Ever wonder why they NEVER showed any fat people? Were all the ancient Greeks thin as rails?

>x bowl
This bowl probably was used in an ancient Athenian temple during rush hour, as an incense holder. That, or the ancient Greeks ate some really HOT cereal, as evidenced by the burn-marks on its bottom

>x plate
The same motif as the urn and the bowl adorn this plate.

Lightning from the storm outside intensely illuminates the library. There is loud thunder quickly following as the storm approaches.

>x siren
The sultry and languid siren that adorns this canvas reminds you of some of Rembrandt's works. As you look into her eyes, you are drawn by her beconing gaze.

>x painting
Which do you mean, the painting of a siren or the painting of an emperor?

>emperor
This painting is of the first emperor of the overly wealthy Rahngu Conetasch Dynasty. He was always fond of tossing his gems to the peasants, in large crowds, to gain favor from his people.

>x key
(the onyx key)
It's a brass key with a handle made of black onyx. Carved in the onyx is "Property of Mangar".

Lightning from the storm outside intensely illuminates the library. There is loud thunder quickly following as the storm approaches.

>take onyx key

>* Odd that you can hear events in the real world from inside the black hole. Maybe some explanation?
[Comment recorded.]

>x graffiti
The graffiti is composed of a crude drawing of a man in obvious distress and some writing. It reads:

"When I first arrived here, it was all in black and white. Now all I see are words. If I remember correctly, I put the two lamps on top of each other, closed my inventory, examined the black hole, opened it, closed it, talked to it, then walked through. Then I found myself here.

>* That works, but where's my attribution?
