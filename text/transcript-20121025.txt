>open door
You open the car door.
You smell leaking gasoline.

>get out of car

Front Yard
You stand at the front porch of a house. This old, Gothic mansion casts gloomy shadows all around you. A sharp wind cuts through your flesh to chill your bones. The pounding thunder grows louder and more threatening. A curiously-shaped knocker adorns the front door. Flanking the front door is a pair of marble statues. 

You can see a mailbox (which is closed) here.

BOOM! There is a mighty explosion behind you as your car bursts into flames. That will at least save you the cost of a tow. Better try to find your younger brother and have him call a cab instead of a tow truck.

>open mailbox
You open the mailbox, revealing an envelope.

>open envelope
You open the envelope, revealing a letter and a pendant.

>open door
The front door creaks open.

Entrance Hall
As you enter the mansion, the door slams closed behind you. Welcome home. You are inside the mansion's foyer. This is a large and luxurious room, yet it feels strangely oppressive. A hallway lies to the north. Another passage leads east.

Covering most of the floor is a room-sized carpet that displays a pentagram. In the east wall is a brick fireplace. Atop the rug is an expensive-looking wooden chair and a couch. A painting of a snake hangs above the fireplace. A painting of an eagle hangs on the west wall. A bust of a sailor stands on a pedestal by the fireplace.

On the mantelpiece is a kerosene lamp.

>eat carpet
(first taking the rug)
The rug is hardly portable.

>i
You're carrying:
  a pendant (being worn)

>smell snake
You smell nothing unexpected.

>x fireplace
The fireplace is a welcome addition to the main hall entranceway. You notice nothing unusual about it.

In the fireplace is a pile of logs.

Lightning from the storm outside intensely illuminates the entrance hall. There is loud thunder quickly following as the storm approaches.

>x sailor
It is the bust of a weathered sailor. The seven seas are etched in his face. It rests heavily on a marble pedestal.

>take sailor
The bust is hardly portable.

(first opening the hall door)

Hall
This room is devoid of any aesthetic warmth or beauty. It is purely functional, with no concern for the trivialities of interior design. To the south is the foyer. Two doors go southwest and west. One door goes east. A staircase leads up. A small painting hangs between the two west-facing doors. Near the staircase is a framed sepia-toned photograph with some writing on it.

Loud thunder echoes all around you as the storm outside intensifies.

>u

Upstairs Hallway
The old wooden floorboards creak under your weight. Your creaking footsteps echo through the emptiness of the huge house. Doors lead west, northwest, east, northeast, and southeast. A stuffed fish hangs on the wall at the end of the hallway.

>x fish
There's something fishy about this trophy.

>search fish
You find a largish product-identification tag tucked behind the fish.

>read tag
According to this tag, this fish is a genuine stuffed and mounted red herring from the Frobozz Magic Fish Trophy Company.

>! Nice!

(first opening the closet door)

Storage Closet
This is a good-sized closet with lots of room for bric-a-brac. Several shelves line the walls. A bare light bulb hangs from the ceiling. You can leave the way you came in, to the north-west.

On the shelf are a filthy bowl, an ashtray, a bottle of No-Ghost, a detergent box, a cardboard box, a thin box, a hatbox, a can of pesticide and a can of spider cider.

A mop leans against the wall.

You can also see a broom and a tarp here.

Lightning from the storm outside intensely illuminates the storage closet. There is loud thunder quickly following as the storm approaches.

>take no-ghost, spider cider
bottle of No-Ghost: Taken.
can of spider cider: Taken.

Upstairs Hallway
The old wooden floorboards creak under your weight. Your creaking footsteps echo through the emptiness of the huge house. Doors lead west, northwest, east, northeast, and southeast. A stuffed fish hangs on the wall at the end of the hallway.

>open no-ghost
As you remove the cap from this small bottle, a foul odor bombards your olfactory senses. The liquid contents of this nearly empty bottle produce a smell similar to that of an injured skunk. It reminds you of the smell of decay that surrounds the house itself.

(first opening the parlor door)
As you touch the doorknob, a strange woman appears. She is dressed like Scarlett O'Hara and stands with her back to you. You pause in wonder.

>throw no-ghost at woman
You splash the foul-smelling liquid on the head of the over-dressed guest. The liquid seems to burn as it drips over her. She lets out a horrifying scream as she begins to melt helplessly. Suddenly you feel like Dorothy (and her little dog too).

>e

Parlor
This parlor has lost its original charm. The cracked, dirty walls are a testament to the estate's state of disrepair. A simple chandelier hangs from the ceiling. An antique chair sits in a corner. In the opposite corner is a large vase of artificial flowers. A veranda can be seen outside to the east. The hallway is to the west.

You can see a vase (in which are some artificial flowers) here.

>eat flowers
(first taking the artificial flowers)
The artificial flowers are plainly inedible.

>sit in chair
You sit on the antique chair. You feel something hard sewn into it.

Veranda
From here you have a splendid view of the desolate estate.

The loneliness of this abandoned estate makes you long for the company of your little brother. You have seen neither hide nor hair of him in quite a while. He should be somewhere on this estate. You'd better find him.

A large black spider quickly runs by you along the railing.

>spray spider cider on railing
A wide aerosol stream sprays from the "Spider Cider" can. It leaves a wet, sticky film on the railing.

You see the spider continue its trek across the railing. It becomes paralyzed as it comes into contact with the "spider cider". It's not dead, but it's not going anywhere without your help.

>take spider
(the black spider)
Taken.

>drop spider cider
Dropped.

Dining Room
This is an impressive sight. You could throw a terrific birthday bash in this room. The odor of stale wine still permeates the air. On the north and south walls are large paintings. Doors lead east to the hallway, north, south, and west.

You can see a dining table (on which are a bouquet of flowers, a champagne bottle (which is empty), a pepper mill and a pewter bowl (in which are a banana, a plum and an apple)) here.

>take bouquet
Taken.

>save

Please supply a filename for save
Ok.

>drink wine
You see no wine here.

>x table
It's a large oak table.

>eat banana

>eat pepper
(first taking the pepper mill)
The pepper mill is plainly inedible.

>i
You're carrying:
  a pepper mill
  a bouquet of flowers
  a black spider
  some artificial flowers
  a pendant (being worn)

You now have to question the reliability of your eyes. You think you see a somewhat cute, abstract creature with a brass key in its hand prance by. You're not sure whether it's your eyes or your mind playing tricks on you. It could be both.

>drop pepper mill
Dropped.

The gremlin zooms away, waving a brass key.

>drop artificial flowers
Dropped.

>w

Kitchen
Upon entering the kitchen, you realize that this room is probably the most modern room in the house. After all, it appears to have been remodeled sometime during the 20th century. The cabinets are very well-made. Small doors head north and south. The dining room is to the east.

On the counter are a menacing knife, a little knife, a cleaver, a chef knife and a stained cookie jar.

On the pot rack are a frying pan, a nonstick pan, a shiny pan, a sauce pan and a roasting pan.

You can see some cabinets here.

>take chef knife
Taken.

>n

Pantry
This pantry smells musty and stuffy. Patches of wallpaper are missing in several spots. This tiny little room does not fit in with the rest of this sprawling palatial estate. A lamp hangs from the ceiling.

On the shelf are a pewter plate, a silver tray, a matchbox, a salami, a kitchen knife, a beater, a baster, a spatula and a thermometer.

You can see a bag of flour, a bag of rice, a bag of sugar and a bag of salt here.

>take matchbox
Taken.

>save

Please supply a filename for save
Ok.

>eat flour
(first taking the bag of flour)
The bag of flour is plainly inedible.

That was definitely not your imagination. This little creature is definitely running circles around you.

Loud thunder echoes all around you as the storm outside intensifies.

>eat salami
(first taking the salami)
You're not that hungry yet.

The evil air that pervades the estate seems to have infiltrated your very being. Your head and chest feel heavy and thick. You find it increasingly difficult to execute your will. For a minute, your thoughts seemed influenced by another mind.

The gremlin skitters away, waving a brass key.

>i

There goes your friend running by again. He is not very sociable. He didn't even say hello.

You open the cabinets, revealing a paintbrush.

The gremlin rockets out of the room, waving a brass key.

Taken.

Servant's Bedroom
Whoever had occupied this room must have been quite satisfied with the small accomodations. There is a simple bed, a floor lamp, and a dresser. A small painting hangs on the wall above the bed. This room does not seem quite as untidy as the rest of the house. You see no dust or cobwebs.

On the bed is a little pillow.

On the dresser are a brush and a cologne bottle.

>turn on lamp
As you turn on the lamp, you see the picture on the wall slide to your left, revealing a small niche in the wall.

Your tired eyes are having trouble focusing on the ghostly figure before you. An angry man's spirit hovers, in chains, in front of you. The ghost speaks: "This is my room. Who let you in here?! These are not the Master's things. They're mine. MINE. MINE. MINE...

>show spider to ghost
The posessive ghost shrieks at the sight of the stunned spider. Flustered and frightened, the spirit dissolves from view, leaving you alone again.

>search niche
In the niche is a dusty journal.

>read journal
"The Master would, or could, not, so I have stolen Dracan's star. He is an evil soul. Unlike the Master, he uses his power for amusement and profit. He is not concerned with spiritual enlightenment. There is no compassion with his power. I grow weak. I am dying. I have hidden the star in Master's special box. It never opens, it has no locks. Dracan's star never discerns. In fire, it freezes. In ice, it burns."

>x painting
This painting looks like Picasso's rendering of "The Twillight Zone's" title shot.

>open dresser
You open the drawer in the dresser revealing nothing.

>turn off lamp
As you turn off the lamp, you see the picture on the wall slide to your right, covering the niche. The ghost disappears.

The quick creature seems to be playing a 'catch-me-if-you-can' game. He's winning. He waves his brass key wildly, teasing you with it as he runs through the room.

>get off chair
You get off the antique chair.

You begin to feel a sense of urgency concerning your little brother. You feel that all is not well. Somewhere on this estate he waits for you to come save him. You must get to him in time.

Loud thunder echoes all around you as the storm outside intensifies.

Cutting that up would achieve little.

>cut eagle painting with knife
Cutting that up would achieve little.

Lightning from the storm outside intensely illuminates the entrance hall. There is loud thunder quickly following as the storm approaches.

Library
This room was designed for deep thought and research. Obviously it was once inhabited by a serious man of letters. The harsh silence in the rest of the house is muted in this room of contemplation. The east wall is completely covered with a bookcase. On the north wall is a framed star chart. A large, well-polished table dominates the middle of the room. Beside the table is an antique globe. The only exit is west.

On the table are a bronze statue and an ancient book.

>open book
(the ancient book)
As you open the ancient book, a tiny scroll slides out.

>read scroll
Carefully written in very tiny script is: 
"Thaumaturgy 101 notes:
Casting Spells:
1) Check the meaning of the words.
2) Say the words to the target of your spell. (target, plugh)
3) Chant the words precisely when there is no target. (chant "xyzzy")

Study for the exam!!!
" 
On the back is some scrawl that reads, "What happened to my notebook? I need to to LOOK UP some chemical elements."

>read book
(the ancient book (which is open))
The book is opened to a page which seems to be filled with definitions. The ones that make the most sense to you are: 
"Instantum: Sudden and momentary; here and gone in an instant. 
Illuminaris: A bright, white light. 
Projectum: The propulsion of an entity. 
Spearca: A small flame or spark. 
Specan: To talk, talking. 
Heafod: The head, the skull, etc. 
Magisterium: Mystery. 
Abraxas: It is a magical word: a vehicle through which magic is directed."

Loud thunder echoes all around you as the storm outside intensifies.

>x star chart
It's a map of the heavens -- a place you've always wanted to visit.

>take lamp
You already have that.

>put lamp on table
As you put the kerosene lamp on the table, it emits a faint hum.

>x star chart
It's a map of the heavens -- a place you've always wanted to visit. You notice a very odd looking star on this chart that you didn't notice before.

>odd star, "specan heafod abraxas"
The star, doesn't say anything, but you now realize you're looking at a black hole.

>x black hole
It look a lot of very powerful magic to retain an actual reduced version of a real black hole here on this star map in this old mansion -- probably an even greater amount to transport it here.

Lightning from the storm outside intensely illuminates the library. There is loud thunder quickly following as the storm approaches.

>enter black hole
Suddenly you experience a feeling quite unlike anything you've ever experienced before. Time and space as you know it are now foreign concepts. You feel what you think is a tremendous acceleration toward the black hole, but you don't know for sure what is happening to you. You're not sure if this experience will ever end. Then suddenly...

Art Gallery
The tasteful "objects d'art" that adorn this gallery might have been offensive to someone with a lesser intelligence. However, having made it thus far, you won't have any problems. There is but a single door leading out of this room, but it's not clear you even got in that way. You can see some apparently frantically-written graffiti on one wall.

You can see a Greek urn, a Greek bowl, a Greek plate, a painting of a siren, a painting of an emperor and an onyx key here.

>eat urn
(first taking the Greek urn)
The Greek urn is plainly inedible.

>x siren
The sultry and languid siren that adorns this canvas reminds you of some of Rembrandt's works. As you look into her eyes, you are drawn by her beckoning gaze.

At this point you begin to worry about your little brother. You were supposed to take care of him, but you have not seen him for hours. You pray that no harm has come to him.

>use paintbrush on siren
You add a few touches to the painting, transforming it into a true work of art. It seems pretty obvious what you think is beautiful.

>x siren
The siren that looked so good before, looks even better with less clothing. Your mind begins to wander... and so does your attention.

>x graffiti
The graffiti is composed of a crude drawing of a man in obvious distress and some writing. It reads:

"When I first arrived here, it was all in black and white. Now all I see are words. If I remember correctly, I put the two lamps on top of each other, closed my inventory, examined the black hole, opened it, closed it, talked to it, then walked through. Then I found myself here. -- Stan Kaufman"

>! Thanks!

>open door
You open the door.

>exit door
You aren'tin the door.

>go through door
As you leave the art gallery through the door behind you, you feel your sense of Newtonian time and space returning once again.

Spinning the globe doesn't seem helpful.

Master Bedroom
This must be the master bedroom. Interesting decor. There is a stale smell about this room, as if it hasn't been opened for years. Along the west wall are a row of photographs and a large wardrobe. Pushed up against the north wall is a large, comfortable-looking bed. Beside it is a floor-standing lamp. The hallway lies east. Another doorway faces south.

You can see a wheelchair and a table (on which are a black diary, a grey candle, a blue bottle (which is empty) and a brown bottle) here.

>unlock wardrobe with key
You unlock the wardrobe.

The smiling, brass key-bearing creature prances quickly past you again. He grins childishly, as if taunting you.

>open wardrobe
You open the wardrobe, revealing a small papyrus scroll, a large papyrus scroll, a wooden box and a golden vial.

The gremlin skitters away, waving a brass key.

>read small scroll
"Together these form a key: antimony, cesium, and bismuth".

There goes your friend running by again. He is not very sociable. He didn't even say hello.

Master Bathroom
Whoever decorated this bathroom certainly had ecelctic tastes. There is a large granite bathtub at one end of the room and a marble sink at the other. The decor could be described as "African Art Deco". The only exit is north.

The quick creature seems to be playing a 'catch-me-if-you-can' game. He's winning. He waves his brass key wildly, teasing you with it as he runs through the room.

You can also see a drain, a shelf (on which are a yellow bottle, an amber bottle and a red bottle), an African mask, a clay mask, a Mayan mask, a Voodoo doll and two towels here.

>x painting
It looks like a still reproduced from F. W Murnau's film, "Nosferatu". There seems to be a familiar face in the background. On closer examination it appears to be Dave Feldman, whose wit and insight was a valuable asset in the creation of "Uninvited".

Again, the evil that dwells within the estate vie for control of your spirit. Its influence grows more and more powerful. Soon you will not have the strength to fight it off. You can feel the spirits collected here are anxiously anticipating your induction.

>x photograph
This is an 8-by-10-inch sepia-toned photograph of two men drinking beer. Written across the bottom is "Thanks to Stan Kaufman, the Inform reimplementation of "Uninvited" was a success and relatively bug free. -- David Griffith."

Covering most of the floor is a room-sized carpet that displays a pentagram. In the east wall is a brick fireplace. Atop the rug is an expensive-looking wooden chair and a couch. A painting of a snake hangs above the fireplace. A painting of an eagle hangs on the west wall. A bust of a sailor stands on a pedestal by the fireplace.

You can see a black spider and a chef knife here.

>open matchbox
You open the matchbox, revealing six matches.

>take match
Taken.

>strike match on matchbox
The blue tip on this short stick bursts into flame.

>put patch on wood
You see no patch here.

>put match on wood
That's better. The dry firewood quickly catches fire. Now it's not so chilly.

>put wooden box on fire
As you toss the box into the fire, a large thick, puff of smoke jumps out. As the smoke clears you notice a brass pentagram that apparently survived the burning of the box has jumped out as well.

Lightning from the storm outside intensely illuminates the entrance hall. There is loud thunder quickly following as the storm approaches.

>take pentagram

Taken.

Hall
This room is devoid of any aesthetic warmth or beauty. It is purely functional, with no concern for the trivialities of interior design. To the south is the foyer. Two doors go southwest and west. One door goes east. A staircase leads up. A small painting hangs between the two west-facing doors. Near the staircase is a framed sepia-toned photograph with some writing on it.

Rec Room
This looks like a room designed for fun and games. It seems out of place on this gloomy estate. To the west is a rustic-looking door. On the east and west walls are some rather ugly paintings. The dining room is to the north. The hallway is to the east.

You can see a chess table, a gramophone and a cabinet here.

Trophy Room
The walls of this room are lined with the heads of dead animals. A mounted bear stands in a corner. A tiger skin covers the middle of the floor. To the north is a door leading outside. You can go back to the rec room using the door to the east.

Greenhouse
This steel and glass structure must have once housed a multitude of life-forms. Now potted corpses inhabit shallow, clay graves. It seems that living organisms don't do too well on this estate. Whoever lived here must have had a gold touch, but no green thumb.

On the table are a blue pot, a brown pot, a yellow pot, a green pot, a red pot and a white pot.

You can see a watering can (in which is some water) here.

A strange creature resembling an eyeball with wings passes in front of you. Did you ever get the feeling that you were being watched?

Nothing is growing in the parched and thirsty soil contained in the blue pot.

A tiny sprout has pushed its nose out of the dry dirt of the blue pot. A tiny plant in its first stage of life now struggles for survival, hoping to grow into lush green vegetation. It still seems thirsty.

Bedroom
This room has a strange energy about it. There is a powerful presence in here. You do not feel alone, just insignificant.

Against the north wall is a bed and bedside table. Above the bed is a small reading lamp. Opposite the bed, on the south wall, is a large, abstract painting. On the west wall is a large wardrobe. The hallway is to the east. A small door is in the north wall.

On the bedside table are a red candle and a star diary.

You can also see a bed (on which are a white pillow and a black pillow) here.

Many of the voices in your mind are not your own. You begin to feel almost at home here among the undead. To your dismay the other world is beginning to look more attractive to you than this one. Its inhabitants beckon to you, but you are not yet ready to join them. You do not know where you found this final reserve of willpower. It came not a moment too soon; it is almost too late.

Bathroom
This bathroom is cold and dark. You can see a white sink and a porcelain bathtub here. There is no toilet. Whoever lived here really did have a mysterious way of doing things. The door is to the south. Your attention is drawn to a strangly-shaped light fixture on the ceiling.

You can see a drain, two towels, a laundry hamper and a marble shelf (on which is a bar of soap) here.

Chapel
You stand in solemn awe in this abandoned house of worship. In the silence you can hear the prayers of righteous predecessors. You feel the presence of many long-dead worshippers. You feel yourself a stranger, yet you feel protected. Beside the altar is a statue upon a pedestal. In the east wall, beside the altar is a beautiful and very large stained glass window. There is a heavy-looking side door in the north wall, which is closed.

On the stone altar are a cross and a white candle.

Church Grounds
You are standing on a path that leads up to a large stone structure. Beyond the structure you see a forest that looks as if it has been ravaged by decay.

As you leave the chapel, a strange ghost flies over you. It does not attack you. The glow of the candle dims the presence of the ghost. It is offended by the flame and flies off to its supernatural home.

From the sound of distant barking, you figure it must be a very large dog.

Before the dazed bird can spread its wings, you grab and quickly trap it in the portable cage. The bird is unharmed, but the uncaged animals then furiously attack each other. The cat snarls but the snake counters with a quick, venomous strike. The poison goes from the snake's fangs to the cat's bloodstream and easily disables and kills the formerly ferocious feline. The snake then swallows the cat with surprising speed.

Church Grounds
You are standing on a path that leads up to a large stone structure. Beyond the structure you see a forest that looks as if it has been ravaged by decay.

As you leave the maze, a strange ghost flies over you. It does not attack you. The glow of the candle dims the presence of the ghost. It is offended by the flame and flies off to its supernatural home.

>i
You're carrying:
  the Blothney Gem
  a cross
  a white candle (providing light)
  a brass pentagram
  a skeleton key
  a matchbox (which is open)
    four matches
  a pendant (being worn)

Again, the evil that dwells within the estate vie for control of your spirit. Its influence grows more and more powerful. Soon you will not have the strength to fight it off. You can feel the spirits collected here are anxiously anticipating your induction.

>s

Chapel
You stand in solemn awe in this abandoned house of worship. In the silence you can hear the prayers of righteous predecessors. You feel the presence of many long-dead worshippers. You feel yourself a stranger, yet you feel protected. Beside the altar is a statue upon a pedestal. In the east wall, beside the altar is a beautiful and very large stained glass window. There is a heavy-looking side door in the north wall, which is open. Through the open door, you can see a churchyard.

The altar has moved sideways, to reveal a small hole.

On the stone altar is a fruit.

You can see a burnt match here.

Rec Room
This looks like a room designed for fun and games. It seems out of place on this gloomy estate. To the west is a rustic-looking door. On the east and west walls are some rather ugly paintings. The dining room is to the north. The hallway is to the east.

You can see a chess table, a gramophone and a cabinet here.

Dining Room
This is an impressive sight. You could throw a terrific birthday bash in this room. The odor of stale wine still permeates the air. On the north and south walls are large paintings. Doors lead east to the hallway, north, south, and west.

You can see some artificial flowers, a pepper mill and a dining table (on which are a champagne bottle (which is empty) and a pewter bowl) here.

Study
You're in a small study. A small desk squats in the middle of the room. To the east is a door. To the south is the dining room.

Brrrr. There is no central heating in this old Gothic mansion. The curved outer wall of this room is exposed to the elements in three directions. It is colder in here than it is outside, and there is no fireplace. It must be awful during the winter.

On the desk is a blotter.

>open desk
You open the drawer in the desk revealing a notebook.

>read notebook
Flipping through the notebook, you see that each page contains a brief handwritten description of each of the chemical elements. It seems to end with "einsteinium". You close the notebook.

(If you want to read about a specific element, just do something like "READ ABOUT CARBON IN THE NOTEBOOK".)

>read about antimony in notebook
#51. Antimony. Sb. A semi-metal known to the ancients commonly used in hardening various alloys. When heated, its vapours are poisonous.

>read about cesium in notebook
#55. Cesium. Cs. A highly-reactive metal which is liquid at room temperatures.

>read about bismuth in notebook

Many of the voices in your mind are not your own. You begin to feel almost at home here among the undead. To your dismay the other world is beginning to look more attractive to you than this one. Its inhabitants beckon to you, but you are not yet ready to join them. You do not know where you found this final reserve of willpower. It came not a moment too soon; it is almost too late.

To the north is a door with what appears to be a relief of the planet Saturn. The door to the south has nothing on it. There is a curious-looking light fixture on the ceiling.

A strange, hideous creature stares at you.

Lightning from the storm outside intensely illuminates the observatory corridor. There is loud thunder quickly following as the storm approaches.

>give fruit to creature
The ugly creature's hungry eyes light up. It pounces on the fruit and swallows it whole in one gulp. While licking its lips with its long tongue, it fades and disappears. The cold, silent corridor now echoes its emptiness

Laboratory
This looks like Doctor Frankenstein's laboratory. You wonder what experiments were performed in here, and by whom. You do not feel very comfortable in here. Embedded in one wall is a small iron safe. In another wall is a small fireplace. A doorwal leads east. A trap door set flush in the floor is closed

Hall
This room is devoid of any aesthetic warmth or beauty. It is purely functional, with no concern for the trivialities of interior design. To the south is the foyer. Two doors go southwest and west. One door goes east. A staircase leads up. A small painting hangs between the two west-facing doors. Near the staircase is a framed sepia-toned photograph with some writing on it.

  a white candle (providing light)
  a brass pentagram
  a skeleton key
  a matchbox (which is open)
    four matches

You still have not found your brother. He needs your help. You cannot suppress the growing sense of foreboding that now overwhelms you.

Stairwell
The stairwell contains an old, rickety spiral staircase that spins up towards the next level. A bare light bulb hangs from the ceiling.

Time passes.

Lightning from the storm outside intensely illuminates the stairwell. There is loud thunder quickly following as the storm approaches.

Upstairs Hallway
The old wooden floorboards creak under your weight. Your creaking footsteps echo through the emptiness of the huge house. Doors lead west, northwest, east, northeast, and southeast. A stuffed fish hangs on the wall at the end of the hallway.

Master Bedroom
This must be the master bedroom. Interesting decor. There is a stale smell about this room, as if it hasn't been opened for years. Along the west wall are a row of photographs and a large wardrobe. Pushed up against the north wall is a large, comfortable-looking bed. Beside it is a floor-standing lamp. The hallway lies east. Another doorway faces south.

On the bed is a cookie.

You can see a wheelchair and a table (on which are a black diary, a grey candle, a blue bottle (which is empty) and a brown bottle) here.

Hall
This room is devoid of any aesthetic warmth or beauty. It is purely functional, with no concern for the trivialities of interior design. To the south is the foyer. Two doors go southwest and west. One door goes east. A staircase leads up. A small painting hangs between the two west-facing doors. Near the staircase is a framed sepia-toned photograph with some writing on it.

>e

Parlor
This parlor has lost its original charm. The cracked, dirty walls are a testament to the estate's state of disrepair. A simple chandelier hangs from the ceiling. An antique chair sits in a corner. In the opposite corner is a large vase of artificial flowers. A veranda can be seen outside to the east. The hallway is to the west.

You can see a vase here.

>e

Veranda
From here you have a splendid view of the desolate estate.

You can see a can of spider cider here.

You see the spider continue its trek across the railing. It becomes paralyzed as it comes into contact with the "spider cider". It's not dead, but it's not going anywhere without your help.

>! Maybe a bug; I think I left the spider somewhere else. Could be a different spider, though.

The quick creature seems to be playing a 'catch-me-if-you-can' game. He's winning. He waves his brass key wildly, teasing you with it as he runs through the room.

The gremlin zooms away, waving a brass key.

Loud thunder echoes all around you as the storm outside intensifies.

>drop cookie
Dropped.

The smiling, brass key-bearing creature prances quickly past you again. He grins childishly, as if taunting you.

Dining Room
This is an impressive sight. You could throw a terrific birthday bash in this room. The odor of stale wine still permeates the air. On the north and south walls are large paintings. Doors lead east to the hallway, north, south, and west.

You can see some artificial flowers, a pepper mill and a dining table (on which are a champagne bottle (which is empty) and a pewter bowl) here.

There goes your friend running by again. He is not very sociable. He didn't even say hello.

Rec Room
This looks like a room designed for fun and games. It seems out of place on this gloomy estate. To the west is a rustic-looking door. On the east and west walls are some rather ugly paintings. The dining room is to the north. The hallway is to the east.

You can see a chess table, a gramophone and a cabinet here.

The kiddie creature runs past waving his cookie. The way he runs around he must get very hungry. This little devil must eat something that makes him awfully hyper.

>w

Trophy Room
The walls of this room are lined with the heads of dead animals. A mounted bear stands in a corner. A tiger skin covers the middle of the floor. To the north is a door leading outside. You can go back to the rec room using the door to the east.

>n

Backyard
This large expanse of backyard reminds you of the "Wizard of Oz". A path leads north across the lawn to three buildings far in the distance.

You recall your childhood fears of thunder and lightning as you remember how your uncle was struck while out golfing in a rainstorm.

>n

Yard Path
You stand at a four-way intersection of paths. North is a greenhouse. West is an observatory. East is an old chapel.

>w

Observatory Entrance
You stand at the entrance of a large domed building to the west. The ugly, elaborate doorway is endowed with a strange, eclectic mix of decorations from at least three different centuries. Two brass orbs atop spires are to the left and right of the door. Just above the door, in the doorframe is an oddly-shaped niche. On the wall above the doorway is a sign reading "Magisterium".

You recall your childhood fears of thunder and lightning as you remember how your uncle was struck while out golfing in a rainstorm.

>w

Observatory Corridor
You're in a short corridor in the observatory. The door leading outside is to the east. To the west is a door with a star on it. To the north is a door with what appears to be a relief of the planet Saturn. The door to the south has nothing on it. There is a curious-looking light fixture on the ceiling.

>w

Laboratory
This looks like Doctor Frankenstein's laboratory. You wonder what experiments were performed in here, and by whom. You do not feel very comfortable in here. Embedded in one wall is a small iron safe. In another wall is a small fireplace. A doorwal leads east. A trap door set flush in the floor is closed

You can also see a table (on which is an array of lab equipment) here.

Cave
You slide, thigh deep, into this bubbling tarpit. You nearly choke on the noxious odor of flesh in decay. Your stomach turns as you slide deeper into the tar. A bat flies by as you watch. You hope it was only a bat. This passage continues north. A side corridor to the west is encrusted with ice. In the ceiling is a trap door.
 A trap door set flush in the floor is open

>w

Ice Cave
You stand in a section of cave that is mysteriously frozen. There is an exit to the south. The entire northern part of the cave is covered with a wall of ice.
An acrid mist rises from the frozen sludge of the ice-encrusted cave. The misty tendrils form themselves into a robed human figure. He has an almost benevolent appearance. He speaks directly to you.

"You've come. I've been waiting for you... for you!"

The mists reform and the old man disappears.

>put pentagram on ice
You put the brass pentagram into the ice. Instantly the star glows red and a strange creature appears. It is shaped like a pyramid covered with flames. It approaches the ice mass and engulfs it. Steam bursts from the block as it rapidly melts. The melting ice creates a flow of water that rushes into the next cave. The current sweeps a human figure from within the ice into the next cave. The robed man reappears and speaks directly to you.

"You must hurry, my son! I've been waiting for a very long time. So has HE. We both lack patience. Hurry and get rid of him -- as far away as possible!"

The old man disappears again.

>n

Cave
This oblong cave contains a strange stone altar. In its center is a deep pit. The southern end of this cave is covered in water, past which is a low passage. To the north is another passage, but dry.

You can see a body here.

>push body into pit
You push the robed man into the dark bottomless pit. His moan echoes for quite some time, gradually fading.

>n

Stairway
A dark, dirt-walled stairway leads up towards a door to the west. Stone and dirt are tightly packed together to form the solid, damp walls. You wonder how long this cavern has existed. You cannot even venture a guess. How old is the house?

>unlock door with brass key
You unlock the wooden door.

>open door
You open the wooden door.

>w
You can hear the high-pitched moans of a young boy and something else. You recognize the pained voice as that of your little brother. It is the first sign of him you have encountered. The sounds seem to emanate from upstairs. The screams cut off suddenly... the silence is deafening.

Study
You're in a small study. A small desk squats in the middle of the room. To the east is a door. To the south is the dining room.

On the desk is a blotter.

The drawer in the desk contains a notebook.

>! Gonna try a few things.

>! Hmm?missing description

>jump into pit
I only understood you as far as wanting to jump.

>go into pit
Your velocity increases as you tumble into the dark pit. The light at the top disappears as you continue your rapid descent. In total darkness you seem to experience a moment of weightlessness just before losing consciousness. You continue to fall...

Bedroom
This seems to be an ordinary bedroom. Against the north wall is a bed and bedside table. Above the bed is a small reading lamp. Opposite the bed, on the south wall, is a large, abstract painting. On the west wall is a large wardrobe. The hallway is to the east. A small door is in the north wall.

On the bedside table are a red candle and a star diary.

You can also see a bed (on which are a white pillow and a black pillow) here.

>x white pillow
This fluffy white pillow seems like a nice place to rest your head.

>x black pillow
You could rest your head on this pillow to take a load off your shoulders.

Bathroom
This bathroom is cold and dark. You can see a white sink and a porcelain bathtub here. There is no toilet. Whoever lived here really did have a mysterious way of doing things. The door is to the south. Your attention is drawn to a strangly-shaped light fixture on the ceiling.

You can see a drain, two towels, a laundry hamper and a marble shelf (on which is a bar of soap) here.

As you enter the bathroom, the door slams shut behind you. Your brother's screams are deafeningly loud in here; it almost seems as if he is on top of you. It's as if someone or something wants you to be here.

The faucet in the tub has turned itself on and the drain appears to have stopped functioning.

The water continues flowing, flooding the bathroom.

You can barely keep your head above water yet have your feet on the floor.

>z
Time passes.

The water is now too deep to touch bottom and breathe. You are now treading water.

>z
Time passes.

Treading water, you rise towards the ceiling.

>grab light fixture
You can't reach the light fixture.

The ceiling gets closer as you rise on the water.

>grab light fixture
You can't reach the light fixture.

The ceiling is within arm's reach as you tread water.

>grab light fixture
You grab the fixture and pull. It comes loose, revealing a large hole in the ceiling.

While treading water, you bump your head on the ceiling.

>u
You grab the edges of the hole and pull yourself through.

Secret Room
This small, claustrophobic chamber is stuffy and cold. It has a single large dirty window. The air in here is so thick that you can barely catch your breath. An iron hatch hinged to cover the hole in the floor from whence you emerged leans against the wall.

Your brother babbles curses and blasphemies. Every few seconds he emits a loud shriek.

>break window with axe
You shatter the window.

>hit brother
You attempt to smack some sense into your brother...

Your brother's expression grows blank and a misty spectre grows out of his body. A demonic visitor appears and begins wailing these foreboding words. "This little one is too weak for me. I need new blood and a stronger body. I need you. I will have you. You will join us...now!"  The hideous creature now hovers, threateningly, in front of you.

Your brother, now freed from the evil demon that was dwelling within, runs out through the shattered window scared out of his wits. And very glad to have them back again.

The demon snarls and roars at you.

>show cross to demon
You display this simple religious symbol and the aggressive demon recoils in terror. The horrifying sight of this small, wooden cross causes the demon's power to ebb. In an instant the menacing apparition fades into nothingness, leaving no tangible evidence of his having been there.

>go through window

Balcony
You climb through the window out onto the balcony. You are surprised that the air is so mild. In fact, a warm pleasant breeze wafts past. A bright, warm sun begins to shine through the clouds. You and your brother bask in the warm, golden glow of a summer sun. Your brother is now himself agains. You are aware of a sense of peace and triumph. You have done very well indeed.

CONGRATULATIONS
By defeating the evil entities that had taken posession of both this mansion and your little brother, you have proven yourself Master of the House of Abraxas.
