Lightning from the storm outside intensely illuminates the hall.  There 
is loud thunder quickly following as the storm approaches.

Again, the evil that dwells within the estate vies for control of your 
spirit.  Its influence grows more and more powerful.  Soon you will not 
have the strength of mind to fight it off.  You can feel the spirits 
collected here are anxiously anticipating your induction.

Loud thunder echoes all around you as the storm outside intensifies.

(on veranda) From the sound of the distant barking, you figure it must 
be a very large dog.

(on veranda) You recall your childhood fears of thunder and lightning as 
you remember how your uncle was struck while out golfing in a rainstorm.

A strange creature resembling an eye with wings passes by.  Did you ever 
get the feeling that you were being watched?

You can hear the high-pitched moans of a young boy and something else.  
You recognize the pained voice as that of your little brother.  It is 
the first sign of him you have encountered.  The sounds seem to emanate 
from upstairs.  The screams cut off suddenly... the silence is 
deafening.

Your brother's screams get louder as you enter the upstairs hallway.  
You must be getting closer to him.

As you enter the bathroom, the door slams shut behind you.  Your 
brother's screams are deafeningly loud in here; it almost seems as if he 
is on top of you.  It's as if someone or something wants you to be here.

The drain in the tub does not seem to be functioning.

This spiggot does nothing.  The water continues flowing, flooding the 
bathroom.  Too bad you didn't bring your rubber ducky.  Your feet now 
start getting wet.  you were really in no hurry to take a bath, but 
there are some things beyond your control.
