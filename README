This game is an unauthorized reimplementation of Uninvited as it 
appeared on the Apple Macintosh presented by ICOM in 1986. No source 
code to Uninvited was used (I've never seen it), nor was any 
decompilation done. The Macintosh game was repeatedly played and 
referred to in the process of creating the Inform code that creates this 
reimplementation. Every effort has been made to make sure this version 
remains faithful to the Macintosh version. Hints and walkthroughs 
prepared for the Macintosh version will, for the most part, work on this 
one. Hints and walkthroughs for other versions may work, but are 
untested.  No Invisiclues-style hints are included in this version.

This game was written in Inform (http://www.inform-fiction.org/) and 
compiled with version 6.30 of the Inform compiler.  The primary 
development machine was an x86 machine with an AMD Athlon 1.2GHz and 768 
megabytes of main memory running Ubuntu Linux.  Development began in 
March 2007 and concluded in July 2012.  By that time, the primary 
development machine was a Thinkpad T42 running Debian Linux 6.0.

This version differs from the Macintosh version in three respects:

1) Descriptions have been expanded and/or completely rewritten to 
compensate for lack of graphics.

2) Some room exits have been moved around to make it easier for the 
player to visualize and for the author to describe in words.

3) Several doors have been removed as they contribute nothing to the 
story or gameplay and only get in the way.


=========
Build  ||
=========

If you're on a Unix system (Linux, *BSD, MacOS 10.x, etc), a Makefile is 
provided for automatically compiling Uninvited.  Simply unpack the 
tarball, go into the directory created, and type "make help".  This will 
show you the possible build targets.  All you need to build this game is 
a default installation of Inform and the "make" utility.  Most, if not 
all, modern flavors of Unix already have make.  You will also need a 
Z-machine interpreter of some sort.

A slightly modified version of Graham Nelson's perlBlorb script is used 
to build the blorb file.  This script can be found at 
http://661.org/if/pblorb.pl or 
https://gist.github.com/DavidGriffith/5097403

If you want to build the Blorb file, you will need to make sure 
pblorb.pl is in the path.  Type "make" twice.  On the first pass, the 
blorb file is built and filled with audio files.  Then the Inform code 
is compiled.  Finally the compiled Zcode is added to the blorb file.  
The first pass of pblorb.pl is needed because it generates src/blurb.inf 
which contains constants necessary for naming the various audio files 
instead of having to remember what resource n happens to be.

As of this writing, cBlorb has bugs in it that prevent easy use with 
Inform6 source code.  For the time being, Blorb building is supported 
only on Unix and possibly Cygwin platforms.

=======================
Compiling Uninvited  ||
=======================

A Unix-style Makefile is provided. This was done mainly as a
convenience for myself while writing the game. If, for whatever reason,
you can't use it or don't want to, simply invoke the Inform compiler on
src/uninvited.inf. Type "make" to build Uninvited with the debug code
included. Type "make nodebug" to build without the debug code.


==============================
Notes on Writing Uninvited  ||
==============================

In order to keep things organized, I gave each room a seperate source 
file.  These files are tied together with rooms.inf which does 
"Include"s for all the room source files.  There are also seperate files 
for verbs, spells, about-info, and objects.  Tying this all together is 
uninvited.inf, which contains the usual beginnings and headers of an 
Inform program.

This source distribution makes no assumptions about any preinstalled 
extensions, nor are they used.  Extensions required to compile this game 
are included in src/extra.  To compile this game, you need an 
installation of Inform 6.33 and version 6/12 of the Inform Library.  Any 
later version should work as well.  This was built with a pre-release of 
6.33, which is why it reports as being compiled by 6.32.
